## Overview

**Challenge:** Business data is stored in tables — orders, customers, events — often billions of rows distributed across many machines. Answering a question such as "revenue by region last quarter" should not require writing a program that iterates over every row.

**Solution:** SQL is declarative: you describe the result, and the engine determines how to produce it — which indexes to use, the join order, and how to parallelize the work. The same core syntax works across relational databases, cloud warehouses, lakehouse engines, and embedded engines.

```
You write:                                    The engine decides:
  SELECT region, SUM(amount)                    scan only 2 columns (columnar)
  FROM   orders                                 skip partitions outside Q3 (pruning)
  WHERE  order_date >= '2024-07-01'             aggregate in parallel on 32 nodes
  GROUP  BY region;                             merge partial sums → 5 rows back
```

**Relevance to data engineering:** SQL is the primary language of warehouses, transformation layers, and data quality checks, and it is central to technical interviews. Joins, aggregation, and window functions deserve particular depth.

## What is SQL?

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the standard language for querying and manipulating relational databases. You describe **what** data you want — the database engine decides **how** to retrieve it.

Data lives in **tables** — a grid of rows (records) and columns (fields). Related tables connect via **foreign keys**. A collection of tables is a **schema**, and a schema lives inside a **database**.

> **Which SQL?** This reference targets standard SQL (ANSI) with notes on Postgres. MySQL, SQLite, and SQL Server follow the same core syntax with minor differences in functions and types.

### Mental model — query execution order

```sql
-- Logical order the engine processes clauses:
-- 1. FROM       — which table(s)?
-- 2. JOIN       — combine with other tables?
-- 3. WHERE      — filter rows
-- 4. GROUP BY   — collapse rows into groups
-- 5. HAVING     — filter groups
-- 6. SELECT     — pick/compute columns
-- 7. ORDER BY   — sort results
-- 8. LIMIT      — cap row count

SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS headcount
FROM   employees
WHERE  active = true
GROUP  BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER  BY headcount DESC
LIMIT  10;
```

---

## Data Types

| Type | What it holds | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| `INTEGER` / `INT` | Whole numbers | `42` |
| `BIGINT` | Large whole numbers (up to ~9.2×10¹⁸) | `9876543210` |
| `NUMERIC(p,s)` | Exact decimal — use for money | `NUMERIC(10,2)` → `1234567.89` |
| `FLOAT` / `REAL` | Approximate decimal (IEEE 754) | `3.14159` |
| `VARCHAR(n)` | Variable-length text up to n chars | `'Alice'` |
| `TEXT` | Unlimited text (Postgres/MySQL) | Long descriptions, JSON strings |
| `BOOLEAN` | true / false | `true` |
| `DATE` | Calendar date, no time | `'2024-03-15'` |
| `TIMESTAMP` | Date + time | `'2024-03-15 09:00:00'` |
| `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Timestamp with timezone (Postgres) | `'2024-03-15 09:00:00+05:30'` |
| `UUID` | 128-bit universally unique identifier | `'550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716…'` |
| `JSON` / `JSONB` | JSON document (JSONB = binary, indexable) | `'{"role":"admin"}'` |

> **Use `NUMERIC` for money, never `FLOAT`.** Float arithmetic is approximate — `0.1 + 0.2` can return `0.30000000000000004`. `NUMERIC(12,2)` is exact.

---

## SELECT

The most common statement. Retrieves rows from one or more tables.

```sql
-- All columns
SELECT * FROM employees;

-- Specific columns
SELECT id, name, salary FROM employees;

-- Computed column
SELECT name, salary * 12 AS annual_salary FROM employees;

-- Alias a table
SELECT e.name, e.department
FROM   employees AS e;
```

### DISTINCT — deduplicate rows

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
-- Returns each department name once, even if 50 employees share it.
```

### Common column expressions

```sql
SELECT
  UPPER(name)                          AS name_upper,
  LOWER(email)                         AS email_lower,
  LENGTH(name)                         AS name_len,
  CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name)   AS full_name,
  COALESCE(phone, 'N/A')               AS phone,   -- first non-null value
  ROUND(salary / 1000.0, 1)            AS k_salary,
  CURRENT_DATE                         AS today,
  AGE(CURRENT_DATE, hire_date)         AS tenure    -- Postgres
FROM employees;
```

> **`COALESCE`** is your null-guard. `COALESCE(a, b, c)` returns the first argument that is not NULL.

---

## Filtering

The `WHERE` clause filters rows before aggregation. Only rows where the condition is **true** pass through.

**Operators:** `=` `!= <>` `< <= > >=` `AND` `OR` `NOT` `IN` `NOT IN` `BETWEEN` `LIKE` `IS NULL` `IS NOT NULL`

```sql
-- Equality and comparison
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary >= 90000;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date < '2022-01-01';

-- AND / OR
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Engineering' AND salary > 100000;

SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'Design' OR department = 'Product';

-- IN — cleaner than many ORs
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department IN ('Design', 'Product', 'Marketing');

-- BETWEEN (inclusive on both ends)
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary BETWEEN 80000 AND 120000;

-- LIKE — pattern matching
-- % matches any sequence, _ matches one character
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE 'A%';      -- starts with A
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE email LIKE '%@acme.com';
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE name LIKE '_lic_';   -- e.g. "Alice"

-- NULL checks — always use IS NULL, never = NULL
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL;  -- top-level managers
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE phone IS NOT NULL;
```

> **NULL is not a value — it's the absence of one.** `NULL = NULL` evaluates to NULL (unknown), not true. Always use `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`.

---

## Sorting & Limiting

```sql
-- ORDER BY (ASC is default)
SELECT name, salary FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
SELECT name, hire_date FROM employees ORDER BY hire_date ASC;

-- Multiple sort columns
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM   employees
ORDER  BY department ASC, salary DESC;

-- Force NULLs last (Postgres)
ORDER BY salary DESC NULLS LAST;

-- LIMIT and OFFSET — pagination
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY id LIMIT 20 OFFSET 0;   -- page 1
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY id LIMIT 20 OFFSET 20;  -- page 2

-- Top-N pattern
SELECT name, salary
FROM   employees
ORDER  BY salary DESC
LIMIT  5;  -- top 5 earners
```

> **Always `ORDER BY` when using `LIMIT`.** Without it, the database returns rows in undefined order — you'll get inconsistent pages.

---

## Aggregates

Aggregate functions collapse multiple rows into a single value. Combine with `GROUP BY` to compute per-group statistics.

| Function | Returns | Ignores NULLs? |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| `COUNT(*)` | Total row count | No |
| `COUNT(col)` | Rows where col is not NULL | Yes |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT col)` | Unique non-NULL values | Yes |
| `SUM(col)` | Total | Yes |
| `AVG(col)` | Mean | Yes |
| `MIN(col)` | Smallest value | Yes |
| `MAX(col)` | Largest value | Yes |

```sql
-- Simple aggregates
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees FROM employees;
SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary, MAX(salary) AS top_salary FROM employees;

-- GROUP BY — one row per group
SELECT
  department,
  COUNT(*)              AS headcount,
  ROUND(AVG(salary), 0) AS avg_salary,
  MAX(salary)           AS top_salary
FROM   employees
GROUP  BY department
ORDER  BY headcount DESC;

-- HAVING filters groups (not rows — that's WHERE)
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS headcount
FROM   employees
GROUP  BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 5;

-- Combining WHERE and HAVING
SELECT department, ROUND(AVG(salary), 0) AS avg_sal
FROM   employees
WHERE  active = true             -- filter rows first
GROUP  BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 90000      -- then filter groups
ORDER  BY avg_sal DESC;
```

> **WHERE vs HAVING:** WHERE runs before grouping (filters raw rows). HAVING runs after (filters groups). You can't use aggregate functions in WHERE.

---

## Joins

Joins combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

| Join | Returns |
|------|---------|
| `INNER JOIN` | Rows with a match in **both** tables |
| `LEFT JOIN` | All rows from left; NULLs where right has no match |
| `RIGHT JOIN` | All rows from right; NULLs where left has no match |
| `FULL OUTER JOIN` | All rows from both; NULLs where either side has no match |
| `CROSS JOIN` | Every row × every row (cartesian product) |

```sql
-- INNER JOIN — only matched rows
SELECT e.name, d.name AS dept_name, d.budget
FROM   employees e
INNER  JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- LEFT JOIN — keep all employees, even if dept is missing
SELECT e.name, d.name AS dept_name
FROM   employees e
LEFT   JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
-- employees with no department get dept_name = NULL

-- Find orphan rows (no matching parent)
SELECT e.name
FROM   employees e
LEFT   JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
WHERE  d.id IS NULL;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN
SELECT e.name, d.name AS dept_name
FROM   employees e
FULL   OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- Joining three tables
SELECT e.name, d.name AS dept, p.title AS project
FROM   employees e
JOIN   departments d     ON e.department_id = d.id
JOIN   project_members pm ON pm.employee_id = e.id
JOIN   projects p        ON pm.project_id = p.id;
```

### Self-join

```sql
-- Employee → their manager (same table)
SELECT e.name AS employee, m.name AS manager
FROM   employees e
LEFT   JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.id;
```

---

## Subqueries

A query nested inside another query. Can appear in `SELECT`, `FROM`, or `WHERE`.

```sql
-- Scalar subquery — returns a single value
SELECT name, salary,
  salary - (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) AS diff_from_avg
FROM employees;

-- Subquery in WHERE
SELECT name
FROM   employees
WHERE  department_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM departments WHERE budget > 500000
);

-- Subquery in FROM (derived table) — must be aliased
SELECT dept, avg_sal
FROM (
  SELECT department AS dept, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal
  FROM   employees
  GROUP  BY department
) AS dept_stats
WHERE avg_sal > 95000;

-- EXISTS — true if subquery returns any rows
SELECT name FROM employees e
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM project_members pm WHERE pm.employee_id = e.id
);
```

> **Correlated subquery:** the inner query references the outer row. Runs once per outer row — often slow. Usually replaceable with a JOIN or CTE.

---

## INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE

```sql
-- INSERT single row
INSERT INTO employees (name, department_id, salary, hire_date)
VALUES ('Jordan Lee', 3, 95000, CURRENT_DATE);

-- INSERT multiple rows
INSERT INTO employees (name, department_id, salary, hire_date)
VALUES
  ('Sam Park',   2, 88000, '2024-01-15'),
  ('Riley Chen', 2, 92000, '2024-03-01');

-- INSERT … SELECT — copy data from another table
INSERT INTO archive_employees
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE active = false;

-- UPDATE — test your WHERE first with a SELECT
UPDATE employees
SET    salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE  department = 'Engineering' AND active = true;

-- DELETE
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 42;

-- RETURNING (Postgres) — see affected rows immediately
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.10 WHERE id = 5
RETURNING id, name, salary;
```

> **Before any UPDATE or DELETE:** run the equivalent SELECT first to confirm which rows you're about to change. Wrap in a transaction so you can roll back.

---

## CTEs — Common Table Expressions

A CTE (`WITH` clause) names a subquery so you can reference it like a table. Makes complex queries readable and avoids repeated subexpressions.

```sql
-- Single CTE
WITH high_earners AS (
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 100000
)
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM   high_earners
GROUP  BY department;

-- Chained CTEs
WITH
active_employees AS (
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE active = true
),
dept_stats AS (
  SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal, COUNT(*) AS n
  FROM   active_employees
  GROUP  BY department_id
)
SELECT d.name, ds.avg_sal, ds.n
FROM   dept_stats ds
JOIN   departments d ON d.id = ds.department_id
ORDER  BY ds.avg_sal DESC;
```

### Recursive CTEs

Used for hierarchical data — org charts, file trees, graph traversal.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE org_chart AS (
  -- Anchor: start at the CEO (no manager)
  SELECT id, name, manager_id, 0 AS depth
  FROM   employees
  WHERE  manager_id IS NULL

  UNION ALL

  -- Recursive step: join each employee to their manager row
  SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, oc.depth + 1
  FROM   employees e
  JOIN   org_chart oc ON e.manager_id = oc.id
)
SELECT depth, name FROM org_chart ORDER BY depth, name;
```

> **CTE vs subquery:** CTEs are not automatically faster. Their advantage is readability and reuse within the same query.

---

## Window Functions

Window functions compute a value for each row using a set of related rows (the *window*), without collapsing rows like `GROUP BY`. The row stays; a new column is added.

```sql
-- Syntax
function_name() OVER (
  PARTITION BY col   -- split into groups (optional)
  ORDER BY col       -- sort within the group
  ROWS BETWEEN ...   -- frame (optional)
)
```

### Ranking functions

```sql
SELECT
  name,
  department,
  salary,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num,
  RANK()       OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
-- RANK skips numbers after ties; DENSE_RANK does not
```

### Offset functions — look at neighboring rows

```sql
SELECT
  hire_date,
  salary,
  LAG(salary)         OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS prev_salary,
  LEAD(salary)        OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS next_salary,
  FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS first_hired_salary
FROM employees;
```

### Running totals and moving averages

```sql
SELECT
  hire_date,
  salary,
  SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date) AS running_total,
  AVG(salary) OVER (
    ORDER BY hire_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW  -- 3-row moving avg
  ) AS moving_avg_3
FROM employees
ORDER BY hire_date;

-- Percent of total
SELECT
  name, salary,
  ROUND(100.0 * salary / SUM(salary) OVER (), 2) AS pct_of_total
FROM employees;
```

### Top-N per group

```sql
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT name, department, salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
  FROM employees
)
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM   ranked
WHERE  rnk <= 3;
```

---

## Indexes & Performance

An index speeds up lookups on a column at the cost of write overhead and storage.

```sql
-- Basic index
CREATE INDEX idx_employees_department ON employees(department);

-- Composite index — order matters!
-- Efficient for: WHERE department = ? AND salary > ?
-- Not for:       WHERE salary > ? (missing left column)
CREATE INDEX idx_dept_salary ON employees(department, salary);

-- Unique index (also enforces a constraint)
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_employees_email ON employees(email);

-- Partial index — index only a subset of rows
CREATE INDEX idx_active_employees ON employees(department)
WHERE active = true;

-- Covering index (Postgres) — avoids heap access
CREATE INDEX idx_emp_cover ON employees(department)
INCLUDE (name, salary);

-- Drop an index
DROP INDEX idx_employees_department;
```

### EXPLAIN — read the query plan

```sql
-- Show estimated cost and plan
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';

-- Run it and show real timing (Postgres)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';

-- Key things to look for:
-- Seq Scan       = full table scan (no index used)
-- Index Scan     = using an index
-- rows=X actual=Y  = estimated vs real row count (large gap = stale stats)
```

### When to index

- Columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN ON`, or `ORDER BY`
- Foreign key columns (Postgres doesn't auto-index these — MySQL does)
- High-cardinality columns (email, UUID) benefit more than low-cardinality (boolean)
- Don't over-index write-heavy tables — every write must update all indexes

---

## Transactions & ACID

A transaction is a sequence of statements that succeeds or fails as a unit. No partial writes survive.

| Property | Guarantee |
|----------|-----------|
| **Atomic** | All statements commit, or none do |
| **Consistent** | The database moves from one valid state to another |
| **Isolated** | Concurrent transactions don't see each other's partial work |
| **Durable** | Committed data survives crashes |

```sql
-- Transfer $500 between accounts atomically
BEGIN;

UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 2;

COMMIT;    -- make it permanent
-- or:
ROLLBACK;  -- undo everything since BEGIN

-- Savepoints — partial rollback
BEGIN;
  INSERT INTO orders (...) VALUES (...);
  SAVEPOINT after_order;

  INSERT INTO payments (...) VALUES (...);
  -- something failed:
  ROLLBACK TO after_order;  -- undo payment, keep order

COMMIT;
```

### Isolation levels

| Level | Dirty Read | Non-repeatable Read | Phantom Read |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| `READ UNCOMMITTED` | Possible | Possible | Possible |
| `READ COMMITTED` | No | Possible | Possible |
| `REPEATABLE READ` | No | No | Possible |
| `SERIALIZABLE` | No | No | No |

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```

---

## Views

A view is a named query stored in the database. It behaves like a table but runs its underlying query each time it's accessed.

```sql
-- Create a view
CREATE VIEW active_employees AS
SELECT id, name, department, salary
FROM   employees
WHERE  active = true;

-- Use it like a table
SELECT * FROM active_employees WHERE department = 'Engineering';

-- Replace (update) a view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW active_employees AS
SELECT id, name, department, salary, hire_date
FROM   employees
WHERE  active = true;

-- Drop
DROP VIEW active_employees;

-- Materialized view (Postgres) — stored on disk, must be refreshed
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dept_summary AS
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS n, AVG(salary) AS avg_sal
FROM   employees GROUP BY department;

REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW dept_summary;
```

> **Materialized views** are snapshots — fast to read, but stale until refreshed. Use them for expensive aggregations that don't need to be real-time.

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| `= NULL` / `!= NULL` | Filter returns nothing | `IS NULL` / `IS NOT NULL`; remember `NULL` compared with anything is unknown |
| `NOT IN (subquery)` where the subquery returns a `NULL` | Query returns zero rows | Use `NOT EXISTS`, or filter `NULL`s out of the subquery |
| Join fan-out (joining to a table with multiple matches per key) | `SUM(amount)` is inflated 2×, 3×… | Check key uniqueness first; aggregate before joining; compare `COUNT(*)` before/after |
| Filtering the right table of a `LEFT JOIN` in `WHERE` | Left join silently becomes an inner join | Put the condition in the `ON` clause |
| `COUNT(col)` vs `COUNT(*)` confusion | Counts differ unexpectedly | `COUNT(col)` skips `NULL`s; `COUNT(*)` counts rows |
| Integer division (`1 / 2 = 0` in Postgres) | Percentages come out as 0 | Cast: `1.0 * a / b` or `a::numeric / b`; guard with `NULLIF(b, 0)` |
| `ROW_NUMBER()` without a unique `ORDER BY` | Dedup keeps a different row each run | Add a tiebreaker column so ordering is deterministic |
| Functions on indexed/partitioned columns in `WHERE` (`DATE(ts) = ...`) | Index or partition pruning not used; full scan | Use a range on the raw column: `ts >= '2024-03-15' AND ts < '2024-03-16'` |
| `SELECT *` in production queries | Breaks when columns are added; scans everything in columnar stores | Name the columns you need |
| `BETWEEN` on timestamps | Includes midnight of the end date, or misses the rest of that day | Half-open ranges: `>= start AND < end` |
| `UNION` when you meant `UNION ALL` | Unnecessary sort/dedup; rows silently disappear | `UNION ALL` unless you need deduplication |

---

## Cheat Sheet

**Which construct?**

| Need | Use |
|------|-----|
| Reusable query, always fresh data | View |
| Expensive query, staleness OK | Materialized view |
| Readable multi-step logic in one statement | CTE (`WITH ...`) |
| Per-row value that looks at other rows | Window function |
| Filter on an aggregate | `HAVING` |
| "Rows in A with no match in B" | `LEFT JOIN ... WHERE b.id IS NULL` or `NOT EXISTS` |
| Several writes that succeed or fail together | Transaction |
| Speed up lookups on a column (OLTP) | Index |
| Insert-or-update | `MERGE` / `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` |

**Syntax you'll write every day**

```sql
-- Dedupe: keep latest row per key
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY updated_at DESC) AS rn
  FROM   raw_orders
) t WHERE rn = 1;                                 -- Snowflake/BigQuery/Databricks: QUALIFY rn = 1

-- Top N per group
... RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) <= 3

-- Running total / 7-row moving average
SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY day ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)
AVG(amount) OVER (ORDER BY day ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)

-- Change vs previous row
amount - LAG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date)

-- Conditional aggregation (pivot)
SUM(CASE WHEN status = 'shipped' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS shipped_count

-- Safe division
revenue / NULLIF(orders, 0)

-- Find duplicates
SELECT id, COUNT(*) FROM t GROUP BY id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Upsert (Postgres)
INSERT INTO t (id, v) VALUES (1, 'x')
ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE SET v = EXCLUDED.v;
```

**Execution order:** `FROM → JOIN → WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING → SELECT → (window functions) → ORDER BY → LIMIT`

**Ranking:** `ROW_NUMBER` 1,2,3,4 · `RANK` 1,2,2,4 · `DENSE_RANK` 1,2,2,3

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is the difference between `WHERE` and `HAVING`?**
A: `WHERE` filters individual rows *before* grouping, so it can't reference aggregates. `HAVING` filters groups *after* `GROUP BY`, so it can: `HAVING COUNT(*) > 5`. Put every condition you can in `WHERE` — filtering rows before aggregation is cheaper.

**Q: Explain the different join types.**
A: `INNER JOIN` returns only rows with a match on both sides. `LEFT JOIN` returns every row from the left table, with `NULL`s where the right has no match. `RIGHT JOIN` is the mirror image. `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns everything from both, matched where possible. `CROSS JOIN` returns every combination (a Cartesian product). Watch for fan-out: if the join key isn't unique on one side, rows multiply.

**Q: What's the difference between `ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`, and `DENSE_RANK`?**
A: All three number rows within a window ordering. On ties, `ROW_NUMBER` still assigns unique numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) — arbitrarily unless the ordering is unique. `RANK` gives ties the same number and then skips (1, 2, 2, 4). `DENSE_RANK` gives ties the same number without gaps (1, 2, 2, 3). Use `ROW_NUMBER` for deduplication and `DENSE_RANK` for "top N distinct values".

**Q: How would you find the second-highest salary in each department?**
A: `DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY salary DESC)` in a CTE or subquery, then filter where the rank equals 2. `DENSE_RANK` means that if two people tie for the top salary, the next distinct salary is still ranked 2.

**Q: How do you remove duplicate rows but keep the latest version of each record?**
A: `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY <business key> ORDER BY updated_at DESC, <tiebreaker>)` and keep `rn = 1` (`QUALIFY` does this without a subquery in Snowflake/BigQuery/Databricks). The tiebreaker matters: without a deterministic order, reruns can pick different rows.

**Q: What is the difference between a CTE and a subquery? Is a CTE faster?**
A: Both define an intermediate result; a CTE names it up front with `WITH`, which makes multi-step logic readable and lets you reference the result more than once. Performance is usually identical, because most modern optimizers inline CTEs. Some engines may materialize a CTE that's referenced multiple times, which can help or hurt. Choose CTEs for readability, and check `EXPLAIN` if performance matters.

**Q: What does `NULL` do in comparisons, joins, and aggregates?**
A: `NULL` means "unknown", so `NULL = NULL` is not true — it's unknown, and rows with unknown conditions are filtered out. Joins on `NULL` keys never match. `COUNT(col)`, `SUM`, and `AVG` ignore `NULL`s, while `COUNT(*)` counts all rows. Use `IS NULL`, `COALESCE`, and `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` (NULL-safe equality) to handle them explicitly.

**Q: A query that was fast last month is now slow. How do you debug it?**
A: Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (or check the warehouse query profile) and compare estimated vs actual rows. Common causes: data growth pushing a join into a spill; stale statistics causing a bad plan; a new function on a filtered column preventing index use or partition pruning; join fan-out from new duplicate keys; or, in a warehouse, a too-small warehouse or clustering that has degraded. Fix the cause — add a filter, fix the join key, recluster — rather than just throwing more compute at it.

**Q: What are ACID transactions and isolation levels?**
A: ACID means atomic (all or nothing), consistent (constraints hold), isolated (concurrent transactions don't see each other's partial work), and durable (committed data survives crashes). Isolation levels trade correctness for concurrency: `READ COMMITTED` (the Postgres default) prevents dirty reads; `REPEATABLE READ` also prevents a row changing between two reads; `SERIALIZABLE` behaves as if transactions ran one at a time.
