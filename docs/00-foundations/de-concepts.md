## Plain English: What Does a Data Engineer Actually Do?

A **data engineer** builds and maintains the pipes that move data from where it's created to where it's useful.

```
Source systems        Pipelines (you build these)       Consumers
─────────────    →    ─────────────────────────    →    ──────────
Your app's DB         Extract → Transform → Load         Dashboards
Stripe/Salesforce     Schedule → Monitor → Alert         Data scientists
Kafka event stream    Handle failures → Retry             ML models
S3 log files          Ensure quality → Document          Analysts
```

**An analogy:** Think of a city's water system. The data engineer is the plumber — not the water company (source systems), not the people who drink the water (analysts/scientists), but the person who lays the pipes, ensures the right pressure, filters out the bad stuff, and makes sure the taps always work.

**Common day-to-day tasks:**
- Build a pipeline that loads Stripe payments into Snowflake every hour
- Fix a DAG that's been failing because the source API changed its schema
- Optimize a slow dbt model that's timing out in production
- Set up monitoring to alert when data is stale or has quality issues
- Help an analyst understand why their revenue numbers don't match

## Foundations

### OLTP vs OLAP

Two fundamentally different workloads that drive almost every architecture decision.

| | OLTP | OLAP |
|--|------|------|
| **Stands for** | Online Transaction Processing | Online Analytical Processing |
| **Purpose** | Run the application | Answer business questions |
| **Operations** | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | SELECT (mostly reads) |
| **Query shape** | Many small, fast queries | Few large, slow queries |
| **Data volume** | Current state (GB range) | Historical (TB–PB range) |
| **Schema style** | Normalized (3NF) | Denormalized (star/snowflake) |
| **Examples** | Postgres, MySQL, Aurora | Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake |

> The job of a data pipeline is usually to move data **from OLTP → OLAP**, reshaping it along the way.

---

### Batch vs Streaming

| | Batch | Streaming |
|--|-------|-----------|
| **When data moves** | On a schedule (hourly, daily) | Continuously, as events arrive |
| **Latency** | Minutes to hours | Milliseconds to seconds |
| **Complexity** | Lower | Higher |
| **Reprocessing** | Easy — rerun the job | Harder — replay from log |
| **Use case** | Nightly reports, data warehouse loads | Fraud detection, live dashboards, alerting |
| **Tools** | Spark, dbt, SQL scripts | Kafka, Flink, Spark Structured Streaming |

**Lambda architecture** — runs batch and streaming in parallel; merges results at query time. Complex to maintain two code paths.

**Kappa architecture** — streaming only; reprocess historical data by replaying the event log. Simpler, but requires a replayable log (e.g. Kafka with long retention).

---

### Data Lake, Data Warehouse, Data Lakehouse

**Data Lake**
- Raw storage for any data format (structured, semi-structured, unstructured)
- Schema-on-read — you define structure at query time, not load time
- Cheap object storage (S3, GCS, ADLS)
- Risk: becomes a "data swamp" without governance

**Data Warehouse**
- Structured, curated, query-optimized storage
- Schema-on-write — data conforms to a schema on ingestion
- Fast analytical queries via columnar storage
- Examples: Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift

**Data Lakehouse**
- Combines lake storage costs with warehouse query performance
- Open table formats (Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, Apache Hudi) add ACID transactions, schema enforcement, and time travel on top of object storage
- Examples: Databricks (Delta), Snowflake on Iceberg, BigQuery with open formats

```
Raw files (S3/GCS)
      ↓  ingest
  Bronze layer  — raw, as-is, append-only
      ↓  clean + validate
  Silver layer  — cleaned, deduplicated, typed
      ↓  aggregate + model
  Gold layer    — business-ready tables, metrics
```

> This Bronze → Silver → Gold pattern (Medallion architecture) is the standard way to organize a lakehouse.

---

### Columnar vs Row Storage

**Row storage** (CSV, Postgres heap): entire row written together. Fast for retrieving a full record. Slow for scanning one column across millions of rows.

**Columnar storage** (Parquet, ORC, Redshift internal): each column stored together. Fast for analytical queries that scan a few columns. Compresses extremely well because similar values are adjacent.

```
Row store:    [id=1, name=Alice, salary=90000] [id=2, name=Bob, salary=85000]
Column store: [id: 1,2,3...] [name: Alice,Bob,Carol...] [salary: 90000,85000,92000...]
```

A query like `SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees` reads only the salary column in columnar storage — skipping name, email, department entirely.

---

## Data Modeling

### Star Schema

The standard analytical model. One central **fact table** surrounded by **dimension tables**.

```
         dim_date
            |
dim_product — fact_sales — dim_customer
            |
        dim_store
```

- **Fact table**: numeric measurements (revenue, quantity, duration). One row per event. Large.
- **Dimension table**: descriptive context (who, what, where, when). Smaller. Joined to the fact table.

```sql
-- Typical star schema query
SELECT
  d.year,
  c.region,
  p.category,
  SUM(f.revenue) AS total_revenue
FROM   fact_sales f
JOIN   dim_date     d ON f.date_key     = d.date_key
JOIN   dim_customer c ON f.customer_key = c.customer_key
JOIN   dim_product  p ON f.product_key  = p.product_key
GROUP  BY d.year, c.region, p.category;
```

**Snowflake schema** — dimension tables are further normalized (e.g. `dim_product → dim_category`). Saves storage but adds joins. Star schema is usually preferred for query performance.

---

### Fact Table Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Transaction fact** | One row per event | Each sale, each click |
| **Periodic snapshot** | One row per period per entity | Account balance at end of each month |
| **Accumulating snapshot** | One row per process instance, updated as it progresses | Order lifecycle (placed → shipped → delivered) |

---

### Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)

How do you handle dimension data that changes over time — e.g. a customer moves cities?

| Type | Strategy | Tradeoff |
|------|----------|----------|
| **SCD Type 1** | Overwrite old value | Simple; history lost |
| **SCD Type 2** | Add a new row with date range; mark old as inactive | Full history preserved; table grows |
| **SCD Type 3** | Add a `previous_value` column | Limited history (only one prior value) |

**SCD Type 2** is the most common in warehouses:

```sql
-- SCD Type 2 example: customer changed city
-- Old row
id=1001, customer_id=42, city='Mumbai',   valid_from='2020-01-01', valid_to='2023-06-14', is_current=false
-- New row
id=1002, customer_id=42, city='Bangalore', valid_from='2023-06-15', valid_to='9999-12-31', is_current=true
```

---

### Normalization vs Denormalization

**Normalization** (3NF) — eliminate redundancy by splitting data into related tables. Reduces storage, prevents update anomalies. Best for OLTP.

**Denormalization** — combine tables, accept redundancy to reduce joins. Faster reads for analytics. Best for OLAP.

```sql
-- Normalized (OLTP): customer address stored once
customers(id, name, address_id)
addresses(id, city, state, country)

-- Denormalized (OLAP): address embedded in customer
dim_customer(id, name, city, state, country)
```

---

## File Formats

### Format Comparison

| Format | Type | Splittable | Schema | Best for |
|--------|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| **CSV** | Row, text | Yes (by line) | None | Simple interchange, small files |
| **JSON** | Row, text | No (unless NDJSON) | None | APIs, semi-structured data |
| **Parquet** | Columnar, binary | Yes | Embedded | Analytics, data lakes |
| **Avro** | Row, binary | Yes | Embedded | Kafka messages, schema evolution |
| **ORC** | Columnar, binary | Yes | Embedded | Hive, heavy analytics |

---

### Parquet

The default format for data lakes. Column-oriented, compressed, self-describing.

**Key features:**
- **Column pruning** — only read the columns your query needs
- **Predicate pushdown** — skip row groups that can't match your filter (min/max stats stored per group)
- **Compression** — Snappy (fast) or ZSTD (better ratio) per column; similar values compress heavily
- **Schema embedded** — no external schema required

```
Parquet file structure:
  Row group 1 (128 MB default)
    Column chunk: id       [min=1, max=50000]
    Column chunk: salary   [min=40000, max=250000]
    Column chunk: dept     [min='Design', max='Sales']
  Row group 2
    ...
  Footer (schema + row group statistics)
```

> A query `WHERE salary > 200000` can skip entire row groups where max salary < 200000 — without reading any data.

---

### Avro

Row-based binary format. Schema stored in JSON alongside the data (`.avsc` file or in the header).

**Key features:**
- **Schema evolution** — add/remove/rename fields with backward/forward compatibility rules
- **Compact** — no field names repeated per row (unlike JSON)
- Preferred for **Kafka** messages and write-heavy pipelines where schema changes are expected

---

### Compression

| Codec | Speed | Ratio | Splittable | Use case |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Snappy** | Very fast | Moderate | No (inside Parquet: yes) | Default for Parquet/Avro |
| **GZIP** | Slow | High | No | Cold storage, CSV |
| **ZSTD** | Fast | High | No (inside Parquet: yes) | Modern default |
| **LZ4** | Fastest | Low | No | Real-time, low-latency |
| **Bzip2** | Slowest | Highest | Yes | Hadoop MapReduce (legacy) |

---

## ETL vs ELT

### ETL — Extract, Transform, Load

Traditional pattern. Transform data **before** loading into the warehouse.

```
Source DB → [Extract] → [Transform in pipeline] → [Load] → Data Warehouse
```

- Transform happens in a dedicated compute layer (Spark job, Python script)
- Warehouse receives clean, ready-to-use data
- Good when: source data is messy, warehouse compute is expensive, or PII must be masked before storage

### ELT — Extract, Load, Transform

Modern pattern. Load raw data first, transform **inside** the warehouse.

```
Source DB → [Extract] → [Load raw] → Data Warehouse → [Transform with SQL/dbt]
```

- Raw data lands in a staging layer; transformations run as SQL inside the warehouse
- Warehouses like BigQuery/Snowflake have cheap, scalable compute — running SQL there is efficient
- Easy to rerun transformations without re-ingesting source data
- Good when: warehouse compute is cheap, you want full raw history, and your team knows SQL

---

### Idempotency

A pipeline is **idempotent** if running it multiple times produces the same result as running it once. Critical for safe reruns after failures.

```python
# NOT idempotent — appends duplicates on rerun
INSERT INTO orders SELECT * FROM staging_orders WHERE date = '2024-03-15';

# Idempotent — deletes first, then inserts
DELETE FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2024-03-15';
INSERT INTO orders SELECT * FROM staging_orders WHERE date = '2024-03-15';

# Idempotent — upsert pattern
INSERT INTO orders (...)
SELECT ...
ON CONFLICT (order_id) DO UPDATE SET ...;
```

> Design every pipeline task to be safely re-runnable. Failures happen. Your pipeline will retry.

---

### Incremental vs Full Load

**Full load** — truncate and reload the entire table on every run. Simple, no state to track. Only practical for small tables.

**Incremental load** — load only new/changed rows since the last run. Requires a high-watermark column (`updated_at`, `created_at`, or a CDC stream).

```sql
-- Incremental load using a watermark
SELECT *
FROM   source_orders
WHERE  updated_at > '{{ last_successful_run_timestamp }}';
```

**CDC (Change Data Capture)** — capture every INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE from the source database's transaction log (e.g. Debezium reads Postgres WAL). The most accurate incremental pattern; no dependency on the source having an `updated_at` column.

---

## Partitioning & Clustering

### Partitioning

Divides a table into physical segments based on a column's value. The engine skips entire partitions that can't match a query's filter — called **partition pruning**.

```sql
-- Unpartitioned: full table scan
SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date = '2024-03-15';
-- Scans 3 years of data to find one day

-- Partitioned by event_date: reads one directory
SELECT * FROM events WHERE event_date = '2024-03-15';
-- Reads only 2024/03/15/ partition

-- Create a partitioned table (Hive-style)
CREATE TABLE events (
  event_id   BIGINT,
  user_id    BIGINT,
  event_type STRING,
  event_date DATE       -- partition column
)
PARTITIONED BY (event_date);
```

**Partition strategies:**
- **Time-based** (most common) — by day, month, year. Matches how analytics queries filter.
- **List-based** — by region, country, status. Good for known, bounded cardinality.
- **Range-based** — by numeric range (e.g. user_id buckets).

**Avoid over-partitioning.** Thousands of tiny partitions (e.g. partitioned by hour + user_id) create excessive metadata overhead. Aim for partition sizes of 100 MB–1 GB.

---

### Clustering / Sorting

Within a partition, **clustering** sorts rows by a column so the engine can skip blocks.

- Redshift: `SORTKEY` — rows physically sorted on disk
- BigQuery: `CLUSTER BY` — rows grouped by column within each partition
- Delta Lake / Iceberg: `ZORDER` — co-locate multiple columns in the same files

```sql
-- BigQuery: partition by date, cluster by user_id
CREATE TABLE events
PARTITION BY DATE(event_timestamp)
CLUSTER BY user_id, event_type;

-- Queries filtering on user_id now scan far fewer blocks
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE DATE(event_timestamp) = '2024-03-15' AND user_id = 12345;
```

**Partitioning vs clustering:**
- Partitioning: eliminates entire partitions (big skips)
- Clustering: eliminates blocks within a partition (fine-grained skips)
- Use both together for best performance

---

## Data Quality

### The Five Dimensions

| Dimension | Question it answers | Example check |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Completeness** | Is all expected data present? | `COUNT(*) > 0`, no NULL in required columns |
| **Accuracy** | Does it reflect reality? | `age BETWEEN 0 AND 120`, `price > 0` |
| **Consistency** | Does it agree across systems? | Row count in warehouse matches source |
| **Timeliness** | Is it fresh enough? | `MAX(updated_at) > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 hours'` |
| **Uniqueness** | Are there duplicates? | `COUNT(*) = COUNT(DISTINCT id)` |

---

### Common Checks

```sql
-- Completeness: no NULLs in required columns
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE customer_id IS NULL;

-- Uniqueness: detect duplicates
SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM   orders
GROUP  BY order_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Timeliness: pipeline freshness
SELECT MAX(created_at) AS latest_record FROM events;
-- Alert if this is older than expected

-- Referential integrity: every order has a valid customer
SELECT o.id
FROM   orders o
LEFT   JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
WHERE  c.id IS NULL;

-- Distribution check: sudden drop in row count
SELECT DATE(created_at) AS day, COUNT(*) AS n
FROM   orders
GROUP  BY 1
ORDER  BY 1 DESC
LIMIT  14;
-- Compare today vs 7-day average — flag if drop > 20%
```

---

### Deduplication

```sql
-- Keep the latest record per entity
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY updated_at DESC) AS rn
  FROM raw_orders
)
SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE rn = 1;
```

---

## Streaming Concepts

### Core Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Event** | An immutable record of something that happened (a click, a purchase, a sensor reading) |
| **Producer** | The service that publishes events |
| **Consumer** | The service that reads and processes events |
| **Topic** | A named, ordered, durable log of events (Kafka's unit of organization) |
| **Partition** | A topic split into parallel ordered logs for horizontal scaling |
| **Offset** | A sequential integer identifying each message's position in a partition |
| **Consumer group** | A set of consumers sharing the read load; each partition is assigned to one consumer in the group |
| **Broker** | A server that stores and serves topic data |

---

### How Kafka Works

```
Producers → Topic (3 partitions) → Consumers (Consumer Group A)

Topic: user-events
  Partition 0: [offset 0] [offset 1] [offset 2] ...
  Partition 1: [offset 0] [offset 1] [offset 2] ...
  Partition 2: [offset 0] [offset 1] [offset 2] ...

Consumer Group A:
  Consumer 1 → reads Partition 0
  Consumer 2 → reads Partition 1
  Consumer 3 → reads Partition 2
```

- Consumers **commit offsets** to track how far they've read. On restart, they resume from the last committed offset.
- Adding partitions = more parallelism. One consumer per partition is the maximum useful scale for a group.
- Messages are **retained** for a configurable period (e.g. 7 days) regardless of whether they've been consumed.

---

### Event Time vs Processing Time

**Event time** — when the event actually happened (in the source system). Stamped by the producer.

**Processing time** — when the event was processed by the pipeline. Can be minutes or hours later due to network delay, retries, or backfill.

```
Event happened:  10:00:00
Kafka ingestion: 10:00:03  (3s network lag)
Stream job sees: 10:04:30  (job was behind)
```

> Always use **event time** for business metrics. Processing time gives you misleading numbers when a consumer falls behind or when replaying historical data.

**Late data** — events that arrive after their event-time window has already been processed. You must decide: drop them, reprocess, or hold the window open longer (watermark).

---

### Windowing

Aggregations over a continuous stream require a window — a bounded slice of time.

**Tumbling window** — fixed-size, non-overlapping. Every event belongs to exactly one window.
```
|--10:00--|--10:01--|--10:02--|
  Count=5    Count=8   Count=3
```

**Sliding window** — fixed size, overlapping. An event can appear in multiple windows.
```
Window size: 5 min, slide: 1 min
[9:55–10:00], [9:56–10:01], [9:57–10:02] ...
```

**Session window** — groups events separated by a gap of inactivity. Size is dynamic.
```
User active 10:00–10:03, idle, active 10:15–10:18 → two sessions
```

---

### Delivery Guarantees

| Guarantee | Meaning | Risk |
|-----------|---------|------|
| **At-most-once** | Message delivered 0 or 1 times | Data loss possible |
| **At-least-once** | Message delivered 1 or more times | Duplicates possible |
| **Exactly-once** | Delivered exactly once | Hardest; requires idempotent consumers or transactions |

> Most production systems aim for **at-least-once** + **idempotent consumers** (deduplicate on the consumer side). True exactly-once end-to-end is expensive.

---

## Orchestration

### What It Solves

Raw scripts and cron jobs break silently and have no dependency management. An orchestrator:
- Defines task **dependencies** (task B only runs after task A succeeds)
- **Retries** failed tasks automatically
- Provides **observability** — logs, alerts, run history
- Supports **backfill** — rerun historical date ranges
- Manages **concurrency** — don't run 50 jobs at once

---

### DAGs — Directed Acyclic Graphs

A pipeline is modeled as a DAG: tasks are nodes, dependencies are directed edges. "Acyclic" means no circular dependencies.

```
extract_orders
      ↓
clean_orders ——→ load_to_warehouse
      ↓                 ↓
validate_orders   refresh_dashboard
```

Each task in a DAG should be:
- **Atomic** — does one thing
- **Idempotent** — safe to rerun
- **Decoupled** — doesn't share state with sibling tasks in memory

---

### Scheduling Patterns

```
# Cron expressions
0 2 * * *      — daily at 2am
0 * * * *      — hourly
*/15 * * * *   — every 15 minutes
0 2 * * 1      — every Monday at 2am

# Airflow schedule examples
schedule_interval='@daily'
schedule_interval='0 6 * * *'    # 6am UTC daily
schedule_interval=timedelta(hours=6)
```

**Important:** in Airflow, `execution_date` is the **start** of the period, not when the task runs. A daily job with `execution_date=2024-03-15` processes data for March 15 and runs on March 16. This trips up almost everyone the first time.

---

### Common Pipeline Patterns

**Sensor** — wait for an external condition before proceeding (file arrives in S3, table row count > 0).

**Branch** — conditionally run different downstream tasks based on runtime logic.

**Fan-out / Fan-in** — split work across parallel tasks, then merge results.

```
          ┌→ process_region_us ─┐
extract ──┼→ process_region_eu ─┼→ merge → load
          └→ process_region_ap ─┘
```

**SLA** — define a deadline for task completion; alert if missed.

---

### Backfilling

Re-running a pipeline for historical dates — to fix a bug, onboard a new table, or apply a new transformation.

Requirements for safe backfilling:
1. Tasks must be **idempotent** (rerunning produces the same result)
2. The pipeline must be **parameterized** on date/time (not hardcoded `NOW()`)
3. Source data must still be available for the historical range

---

## Key Tools Landscape

A map of what each tool solves — not tutorials, just the mental model.

---

## Putting It Together

A typical modern data stack looks like this:

```
Sources                 Ingestion           Storage              Serving
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Postgres (OLTP)  ──────→ Debezium/Kafka ──→ Bronze (raw S3)
SaaS APIs        ──────→ Airbyte        ──→     ↓
Clickstream      ──────→ Kafka          ──→ Silver (cleaned)    BI tools
                                        ──→     ↓               (Tableau,
                                            Gold (modeled) ───→  Looker,
                                            (dbt transforms)     Metabase)
                                                 ↑
                                           Orchestrated by
                                           Airflow / Dagster
```

**The key insight:** each layer has one job.
- **Bronze** — land raw data, never modify it. It's your source of truth for reprocessing.
- **Silver** — clean, validate, deduplicate. Schema is enforced here.
- **Gold** — business logic lives here. Star schema, aggregations, metrics.

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is the difference between OLTP and OLAP? Give an example of each.**
A: OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems run the business — they handle many small, fast read/write queries like inserting a new order or updating an account balance. Examples: PostgreSQL, MySQL. OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) systems answer business questions — they run few but complex analytical queries over large datasets. Examples: Snowflake, BigQuery. The key difference: OLTP is normalized for writes; OLAP is denormalized for reads.

**Q: What is the medallion architecture and why do we use it?**
A: Bronze/Silver/Gold — a three-layer pattern where raw data lands in Bronze unchanged, is cleaned and validated in Silver, and becomes business-ready (star schema, aggregates) in Gold. We use it because it separates concerns: Bronze is the safety net (can always reprocess), Silver enforces quality, Gold optimizes for queries. Each layer has a clear owner and a clear definition of done.

**Q: What is the difference between ETL and ELT?**
A: ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) transforms data before loading it into the destination — traditional, needed when the destination is expensive or slow. ELT (Extract-Load-Transform) loads raw data first, then transforms it using the destination's compute — modern approach enabled by cheap cloud warehouses. dbt is an ELT tool: you load raw data into Snowflake, then transform it with SQL inside Snowflake.

**Q: What is idempotency in data pipelines and why does it matter?**
A: An idempotent pipeline produces the same result whether it runs once or ten times. It matters because pipelines fail and get retried — if a retry inserts duplicate rows, your data is wrong. Common patterns: use MERGE/upsert instead of INSERT, use DELETE+INSERT with a date partition, or use deduplication logic (dbt's `unique_key` on incremental models).

**Q: What is partitioning and how does it improve query performance?**
A: Partitioning divides a large table into sub-groups based on a column value (usually date). When you query with a filter on the partition column (`WHERE date = '2024-03-15'`), the query engine only reads that partition's files — skipping 99%+ of the data. Without partitioning, every query scans the entire table. For time-series data (orders, events), partitioning by day is almost always the right choice.

**Q: What is the difference between a data lake, a data warehouse, and a lakehouse?**
A: A data lake stores raw files in any format on cheap object storage (S3) — flexible but no schema enforcement or transactions. A data warehouse stores structured, optimized data in a proprietary format — great for queries but expensive and schema-rigid. A lakehouse combines both: open file formats (Parquet/Delta/Iceberg) on object storage, with a metadata layer that adds warehouse features (ACID, schema enforcement, time travel). Databricks and Delta Lake are examples.

**Q: What is a data contract and when would you need one?**
A: A data contract is a formal agreement between the producer of a dataset and its consumers — specifying schema, data types, SLA (freshness guarantee), quality rules, and ownership. You need one when multiple teams depend on a dataset: the contract prevents the upstream team from silently breaking downstream pipelines with schema changes or delayed delivery.
