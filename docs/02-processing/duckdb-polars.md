## Overview

**Challenge:** Many datasets are too large or slow for pandas — which is single-threaded and loads everything into memory — yet far too small to justify a Spark cluster's cost and operational overhead. Tens or hundreds of gigabytes of Parquet on a laptop or a single cloud VM falls into this gap.

**Solution:** Two modern engines fill it. **DuckDB** is an in-process analytical SQL database (think "SQLite for analytics"); **Polars** is a DataFrame library with a lazy query optimizer. Both are columnar, multi-threaded, vectorized, read Parquet and object storage directly, and can process data larger than memory.

```
Data size        Typical tool
─────────────    ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
< 1 GB           pandas, DuckDB, Polars — any works
1 GB – ~1 TB     DuckDB or Polars on one machine (spill to disk when needed)
> 1 TB, or many  Spark, a warehouse, or a lakehouse engine
concurrent users
```

**Relevance to data engineering:** these engines make local development, CI tests, small and medium pipelines, and data exploration dramatically faster and cheaper — often replacing a cluster job with a single container.

## When to Use Which

| | pandas | Polars | DuckDB | Spark |
|-|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Interface | DataFrame | DataFrame (eager + lazy) | SQL (plus relational Python API) | DataFrame + SQL |
| Execution | Single-threaded, eager | Multi-threaded, query-optimized | Multi-threaded, query-optimized | Distributed cluster |
| Larger than memory | No | Yes (streaming engine) | Yes (spills to disk) | Yes |
| Best at | Small data, ecosystem breadth | DataFrame pipelines, feature engineering | SQL analytics, joins, ad hoc queries over files | Terabytes+, cluster-scale jobs |
| Deployment | Library | Library | Library (embedded database) | Cluster or managed service |

**Rule of thumb:** use DuckDB if your team thinks in SQL, Polars if it thinks in DataFrames — and they interoperate, so mixing them is easy.

## DuckDB Basics

```python
import duckdb

# Query files directly — no loading step
duckdb.sql("""
    SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS revenue
    FROM 'data/orders/*.parquet'
    WHERE order_date >= DATE '2024-03-01'
    GROUP BY region
    ORDER BY revenue DESC
""").show()

# Persistent database file (tables survive restarts)
con = duckdb.connect("analytics.duckdb")
con.sql("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS orders AS SELECT * FROM 'data/orders/*.parquet'")

# Results as pandas, Polars, or Arrow
df_pandas = con.sql("SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 1000").df()
df_polars = con.sql("SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 1000").pl()
table     = con.sql("SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 1000").arrow()

# Parameterized queries
con.execute("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ?", [42]).fetchall()
```

**Handy SQL features:** `SUMMARIZE tbl` (profile every column) · `DESCRIBE` · `SELECT * EXCLUDE (col)` · `GROUP BY ALL` · `QUALIFY` · `PIVOT` / `UNPIVOT` · list and struct types · `read_json` with schema inference

---

## Polars Basics

```python
import polars as pl

orders = pl.read_parquet("data/orders/*.parquet")        # eager

result = (
    orders
    .filter(pl.col("status") == "shipped")
    .with_columns(
        (pl.col("amount") * pl.col("fx_rate")).alias("amount_usd"),
        pl.col("order_ts").dt.date().alias("order_date"),
    )
    .group_by("region", "order_date")
    .agg(
        pl.col("amount_usd").sum().alias("revenue"),
        pl.col("order_id").n_unique().alias("orders"),
    )
    .sort("revenue", descending=True)
)

# Conditional logic and window functions
orders = orders.with_columns(
    pl.when(pl.col("amount") > 1000).then(pl.lit("large")).otherwise(pl.lit("standard")).alias("size"),
    pl.col("amount").sum().over("customer_id").alias("customer_total"),
    pl.col("order_ts").rank("ordinal").over("customer_id").alias("order_seq"),
)

# Joins
enriched = orders.join(customers, on="customer_id", how="left")
```

**Lazy mode** (`scan_*` + `.collect()`) lets Polars optimize the whole query — pushing filters and column selection into the file scan:

```python
revenue = (
    pl.scan_parquet("data/orders/*.parquet")             # nothing is read yet
    .filter(pl.col("order_date") >= pl.date(2024, 3, 1))
    .group_by("region")
    .agg(pl.col("amount").sum())
    .collect()                                           # optimize, then execute
)
print(pl.scan_parquet("data/orders/*.parquet").filter(pl.col("region") == "EU").explain())
```

---

## Reading and Writing Files

```sql
-- DuckDB
SELECT * FROM read_csv('raw/customers_*.csv', header = true);              -- types inferred
SELECT * FROM read_json('raw/events/*.json.gz');
SELECT * FROM read_parquet('lake/orders/*/*.parquet', hive_partitioning = true);

-- Write partitioned Parquet (for local paths, the parent directory must already exist)
COPY (SELECT *, CAST(order_ts AS DATE) AS order_date FROM orders)
TO 'lake/orders' (FORMAT parquet, PARTITION_BY (order_date), COMPRESSION zstd);
```

```python
# Polars
df = pl.read_csv("raw/customers.csv", try_parse_dates=True)
lf = pl.scan_parquet("lake/orders/**/*.parquet", hive_partitioning=True)
df.write_parquet("out/customers.parquet", compression="zstd")
lf.sink_parquet("out/orders_clean.parquet")        # write without materializing in memory
```

---

## Object Storage and Lakehouse Formats

```sql
-- DuckDB: read directly from S3 / GCS / Azure
INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs;
CREATE SECRET (TYPE s3, PROVIDER credential_chain);     -- uses the standard AWS credential chain

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM 's3://my-lake/orders/order_date=2024-03-15/*.parquet';

-- Open table formats
INSTALL iceberg; LOAD iceberg;
SELECT * FROM iceberg_scan('s3://my-lake/warehouse/orders');

INSTALL delta; LOAD delta;
SELECT * FROM delta_scan('s3://my-lake/delta/orders');
```

```python
# Polars: object storage via storage options (credentials can also come from the environment)
lf = pl.scan_parquet(
    "s3://my-lake/orders/order_date=2024-03-15/*.parquet",
    storage_options={"aws_region": "eu-west-1"},
)
```

Filters on partition columns and Parquet statistics mean only the needed files and row groups are downloaded.

---

## Interoperability

Both engines use **Apache Arrow** in memory, so data moves between them — and pandas — with little or no copying.

```python
import duckdb, polars as pl, pandas as pd

pdf = pd.read_csv("small.csv")
plf = pl.DataFrame({"id": [1, 2], "score": [0.4, 0.9]})

# DuckDB can query pandas and Polars DataFrames by variable name
duckdb.sql("SELECT p.*, s.score FROM pdf AS p JOIN plf AS s USING (id)").pl()

# Polars ↔ pandas ↔ Arrow
plf.to_pandas(); pl.from_pandas(pdf); plf.to_arrow()

# Polars can run SQL too
pl.SQLContext(orders=plf).execute("SELECT id FROM orders WHERE score > 0.5").collect()
```

---

## Larger-than-Memory Processing

```python
# DuckDB: cap memory and spill to disk for large joins, sorts, and aggregations
con = duckdb.connect()
con.sql("SET memory_limit = '8GB'")
con.sql("SET temp_directory = '/mnt/scratch/duckdb_tmp'")
con.sql("""
    COPY (
        SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS lifetime_value
        FROM 'lake/orders/**/*.parquet'
        GROUP BY customer_id
    ) TO 'out/ltv.parquet' (FORMAT parquet)
""")

# Polars: the streaming engine processes data in batches
(pl.scan_parquet("lake/orders/**/*.parquet")
   .group_by("customer_id")
   .agg(pl.col("amount").sum().alias("lifetime_value"))
   .sink_parquet("out/ltv.parquet"))           # or .collect(engine="streaming") in recent versions
```

Streaming works best for scans, filters, projections, and aggregations; some operations (certain window functions, sorts over everything) need more memory.

---

## Performance Tips

- **Use Parquet**, not CSV, for anything read more than once; partition by common filters
- **Stay lazy** in Polars (`scan_*`) and let DuckDB read files directly — both push down filters and column selection
- **Avoid Python row loops and UDFs** (`apply`, `map_elements`) — use built-in expressions
- **Select only needed columns** early
- **Right-size files:** hundreds of MB per file, not thousands of tiny files
- **Set threads and memory** explicitly in containers (`SET threads = 4`; Polars uses `POLARS_MAX_THREADS`) so the engine doesn't assume the host's full resources

---

## Pipelines and Testing Patterns

**A containerized batch job instead of a cluster**

```python
from datetime import date

import duckdb

def run(run_date: str) -> None:
    day = date.fromisoformat(run_date).isoformat()          # validates the input before it touches SQL
    output = f"s3://my-lake/gold/orders_enriched/order_date={day}/data.parquet"

    con = duckdb.connect()
    con.sql("INSTALL httpfs; LOAD httpfs; CREATE SECRET (TYPE s3, PROVIDER credential_chain);")
    # Query inputs can be parameters; the COPY target must be a literal path
    con.execute(f"""
        COPY (
            SELECT o.order_id, o.customer_id, o.amount, c.region, o.order_date
            FROM read_parquet('s3://my-lake/silver/orders/order_date=' || $day || '/*.parquet') AS o
            JOIN read_parquet('s3://my-lake/silver/customers/*.parquet') AS c USING (customer_id)
        ) TO '{output}' (FORMAT parquet)
    """, {"day": day})               # overwrites the day's output file: safe to rerun
```

**Fast local and CI tests:** run SQL transformation logic against small fixture files with DuckDB, so tests take seconds without a warehouse connection. Transformation frameworks such as dbt and SQLMesh have DuckDB adapters for exactly this.

**Local development against production-shaped data:** sample a few partitions from object storage into a local DuckDB file and iterate offline.

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Treating DuckDB as a shared server database | Lock errors with multiple writers | One writer process per database file; use a server database or MotherDuck for concurrent access |
| Using Polars eagerly on big files | Out-of-memory errors | `scan_*` + lazy queries + `sink_*` or streaming collect |
| Row-wise Python functions | 10–100× slower than expected | Native expressions or SQL functions |
| Reading thousands of tiny files | Slow scans dominated by file overhead | Compact into larger Parquet files |
| CSV type inference surprises | IDs lose leading zeros; wrong date parsing | Declare column types explicitly for production reads |
| No memory limit in containers | The container is OOM-killed | `SET memory_limit`, a temp directory, `POLARS_MAX_THREADS` |
| Choosing a single-node engine for ever-growing data | Jobs slow down as volume grows | Plan the migration path (same SQL on a warehouse or Spark) before you hit the limit |
| Mixing API versions from old tutorials | Deprecation warnings or errors (e.g. `groupby` vs `group_by`) | Pin library versions and follow current docs |

## Cheat Sheet

| Task | DuckDB | Polars |
|------|--------|--------|
| Read Parquet | `SELECT * FROM 'path/*.parquet'` | `pl.scan_parquet("path/*.parquet")` |
| Filter | `WHERE status = 'shipped'` | `.filter(pl.col("status") == "shipped")` |
| New column | `SELECT *, amount * 1.2 AS gross` | `.with_columns((pl.col("amount") * 1.2).alias("gross"))` |
| Aggregate | `GROUP BY region` + `SUM(amount)` | `.group_by("region").agg(pl.col("amount").sum())` |
| Window | `SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id)` | `pl.col("amount").sum().over("customer_id")` |
| Latest per key | `QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY ts DESC) = 1` | `.sort("ts", descending=True).unique("id", keep="first")` |
| Join | `JOIN c USING (customer_id)` | `.join(c, on="customer_id", how="left")` |
| Write Parquet | `COPY (...) TO 'out.parquet' (FORMAT parquet)` | `.sink_parquet("out.parquet")` / `.write_parquet(...)` |
| Profile data | `SUMMARIZE tbl` | `df.describe()` |
| To pandas | `.df()` | `.to_pandas()` |

## Interview Questions

**Q: Why are DuckDB and Polars so much faster than pandas?**
A: They use columnar, vectorized execution — processing batches of values with CPU-efficient operations — across all cores, while pandas executes most operations on a single thread. They also have query optimizers: filters and column selection are pushed into file scans, joins are planned, and unnecessary work is removed. Finally, they can stream or spill to disk, so they aren't limited by memory the way pandas is.

**Q: When would you choose DuckDB or Polars over Spark?**
A: When the data fits on one machine — up to hundreds of gigabytes, sometimes more with spilling — and the job doesn't need a cluster's parallelism. A single process avoids cluster startup time, scheduling overhead, and cost, and is simpler to test and deploy (a container in an orchestrator). Spark remains the right choice for terabyte-scale data, very large shuffles, or when the platform is already built around it.

**Q: What is lazy evaluation in Polars and why does it matter?**
A: With `scan_*` functions and `LazyFrame`, operations build a query plan instead of executing immediately. On `collect()` or `sink_*`, Polars optimizes the whole plan — predicate and projection pushdown into the file scan, combining operations, choosing join strategies — and can execute it in a streaming fashion. That reads less data, uses less memory, and runs faster than executing each step eagerly.

**Q: How can DuckDB help in a data engineering workflow even if production runs on a warehouse?**
A: It's an excellent local and CI engine: SQL logic can be tested against small fixture files in seconds, without warehouse credentials or cost. It's also useful for inspecting and profiling files in object storage, validating data before loading, and running small scheduled jobs in a container instead of on a warehouse or cluster.
