## Overview

**Challenge:** Source systems were built to run the business, not to feed analytics. Their data sits behind rate-limited APIs, in operational databases that must not be slowed down, and in files that arrive late, twice, or with a different schema than last week. Every downstream table is only as good as the ingestion layer that feeds it.

**Solution:** A deliberate ingestion design chooses, per source, *how* data is captured (full extract, incremental extract, change data capture, or event streaming), *where* it lands (an immutable raw layer), and *how* it is applied to downstream tables (append, overwrite, or merge) — with idempotency, schema handling, and monitoring built in.

```
Source                    Capture method                Landing (raw / bronze)          Apply
──────────────────────    ──────────────────────────    ────────────────────────────    ──────────────────
SaaS / REST APIs      →   incremental pull (cursor)  →  files or tables, append-only →  MERGE / overwrite
Files (SFTP, buckets) →   event-driven pickup        →  partitioned by arrival date  →  append / overwrite
OLTP databases        →   CDC from the transaction log → change events (Kafka / files) → MERGE (upsert + delete)
Applications          →   event streaming            →  topics → raw tables          →  append
```

**Relevance to data engineering:** ingestion is where most production incidents start — missed records, duplicates, silent schema changes, and source outages. Getting it right makes every downstream layer simpler.

## Ingestion Patterns

| Pattern | How it works | Latency | Captures deletes? | Load on source | Typical sources |
|---------|--------------|---------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Full extract** | Copy the whole dataset every run | Hours | Yes (by comparison) | High | Small reference tables |
| **Incremental extract** | Copy rows changed since the last watermark | Minutes–hours | No | Medium | Tables with a reliable `updated_at` |
| **Change data capture** | Read inserts, updates, and deletes from the database log | Seconds | Yes | Low | OLTP databases |
| **Event streaming** | Applications publish events as they happen | Seconds | N/A (events) | None | Clickstream, IoT, microservices |
| **File drop** | Partners or systems deliver files to a location | Batch | Depends on content | None | Partner feeds, exports |
| **API pull** | Call a service's API on a schedule | Minutes–hours | Rarely | Rate-limited | SaaS tools |

**Choosing:** use CDC for operational databases when you need deletes or low latency; incremental extracts when CDC isn't available and the source has a trustworthy change column; full extracts only for small tables; event streaming when you own the producing application.

---

## Full vs Incremental Loads

```python
from datetime import datetime, timezone

def extract_incremental(conn, table: str, watermark_store) -> list[dict]:
    """Pull rows changed since the last successful run, with an overlap window."""
    last = watermark_store.get(table) or datetime(1970, 1, 1, tzinfo=timezone.utc)
    lookback = last.replace(microsecond=0)   # optionally subtract minutes to catch late commits

    rows = conn.execute(
        f"SELECT * FROM {table} WHERE updated_at >= %s ORDER BY updated_at",
        (lookback,),
    ).fetchall()

    if rows:
        write_to_raw(table, rows)                                  # append-only landing
        watermark_store.set(table, max(r["updated_at"] for r in rows))   # only after a successful write
    return rows
```

**Rules for incremental loads**
- Use `>=` with a small overlap (plus deduplication downstream) rather than `>` — transactions can commit out of timestamp order
- Advance the watermark only after the data is durably written
- Store watermarks outside the job (a table or key-value store), keyed by source and table
- Schedule periodic full reconciliations: `updated_at`-based extraction never sees hard deletes

---

## The Raw Landing Layer

Land data exactly as received, before any transformation:

```
raw/<source>/<entity>/ingest_date=2024-03-15/batch_id=01HS9.../part-0000.json.gz
                                              └── one folder per run: safe to rerun, easy to audit
```

| Principle | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Immutable, append-only | You can always reprocess downstream from the original data |
| Partition by *arrival* time | Makes reruns and late data easy to reason about |
| Store the raw payload plus metadata (`_ingested_at`, `_source`, `_batch_id`, `_schema_version`) | Lineage, debugging, and deduplication |
| Keep the original format (JSON, CSV) or a lossless conversion | Nothing is lost before you understand it |
| Lifecycle rules to cheaper storage | Raw data is large and rarely read |

---

## Ingesting from APIs

```python
import time
import requests
from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
from urllib3.util.retry import Retry

def api_session() -> requests.Session:
    s = requests.Session()
    retry = Retry(total=5, backoff_factor=1,
                  status_forcelist=[429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
                  respect_retry_after_header=True)
    s.mount("https://", HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retry))
    return s

def fetch_changed_records(base_url: str, token: str, updated_since: str):
    """Cursor-paginated incremental extract. Yields pages so memory stays flat."""
    session = api_session()
    params = {"updated_since": updated_since, "limit": 500}
    while True:
        resp = session.get(f"{base_url}/v1/invoices", params=params,
                           headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}, timeout=30)
        resp.raise_for_status()
        body = resp.json()
        yield body["data"]
        cursor = body.get("next_cursor")
        if not cursor:
            break
        params["cursor"] = cursor
        time.sleep(0.2)                         # stay well inside rate limits
```

| Concern | Practice |
|---------|----------|
| Pagination | Prefer cursor-based over offset-based (offsets skip or repeat rows when data changes mid-extract) |
| Rate limits | Honour `Retry-After`; throttle proactively; spread large backfills over time |
| Incremental cursor | Use the API's `updated_since` / change-feed endpoint; persist the high-water mark |
| Authentication | Tokens from a secrets manager; handle OAuth refresh |
| Deletes | Look for a deleted/archived flag or events endpoint; otherwise reconcile periodically |
| Idempotency | Write each run to its own batch folder; deduplicate by record ID downstream |

---

## Ingesting Files

```
Partner drops file → object storage event → queue → loader
                                                     ├─ validate: name, size, checksum, schema
                                                     ├─ copy to raw/<source>/ingest_date=.../
                                                     ├─ record in a load manifest (file, checksum, rows, status)
                                                     └─ on failure → quarantine/ + alert
```

- **Detect files with events, not listings:** storage notifications (to a queue) scale better than listing millions of keys
- **Keep a manifest** of processed files (name + checksum) so the same file is never loaded twice and a re-delivered file is detected
- **Wait for completeness:** use `_SUCCESS` / manifest files or a size-stable check — partners often upload in pieces
- **Validate early:** reject files with unexpected columns, encodings, or row counts into a quarantine area

## Extracting from Databases

```python
# Parallel JDBC read in Spark: split the table into ranges of a numeric key
df = (spark.read.format("jdbc")
      .option("url", "jdbc:postgresql://replica-db:5432/app")      # read from a replica, not the primary
      .option("dbtable", "(SELECT * FROM orders WHERE updated_at >= '2024-03-15') AS src")
      .option("user", user).option("password", password)
      .option("partitionColumn", "order_id")
      .option("lowerBound", 1).option("upperBound", 50_000_000)
      .option("numPartitions", 16)                                 # 16 concurrent queries — check the source can take it
      .option("fetchsize", 10_000)
      .load())
```

- Read from a **read replica** or snapshot, never the primary under load
- Get a **consistent snapshot** for multi-table extracts (same transaction or snapshot timestamp)
- Limit parallelism to what the source can handle; agree limits with the database owners
- For large or frequently changing tables, move to **CDC** instead of repeated extracts

---

## Change Data Capture (CDC)

CDC captures every insert, update, and delete from a source database as an ordered stream of change events.

| Approach | How | Deletes | Source impact | Notes |
|----------|-----|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Log-based** | Read the transaction log (Postgres WAL, MySQL binlog, SQL Server CDC tables, Oracle redo) | Yes | Minimal | The standard approach (Debezium, cloud DMS, managed connectors) |
| **Query-based** | Poll with `WHERE updated_at > watermark` | No | Query load | Simple; misses deletes and intermediate states |
| **Trigger-based** | Triggers write changes to an audit table | Yes | Write overhead on every transaction | Legacy; avoid on busy databases |

**What log-based CDC gives you:** every change in commit order, including deletes; before-and-after row images; the log position (LSN/offset) for exactly-once bookkeeping; and minimal load on the source.

---

## CDC with Debezium

Debezium is an open-source CDC platform that runs as Kafka Connect source connectors (or embedded / as Debezium Server). Each captured table becomes a Kafka topic.

**Postgres prerequisites:** `wal_level = logical`, a user with replication privileges, and a publication for the captured tables.

```json
{
  "name": "orders-postgres-cdc",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
    "plugin.name": "pgoutput",
    "database.hostname": "app-db.internal",
    "database.port": "5432",
    "database.user": "debezium",
    "database.password": "${file:/secrets/db.properties:password}",
    "database.dbname": "app",
    "topic.prefix": "app",
    "table.include.list": "public.orders,public.customers",
    "slot.name": "debezium_orders",
    "publication.autocreate.mode": "filtered",
    "snapshot.mode": "initial"
  }
}
```

**Change event (simplified):**

```json
{
  "before": {"order_id": 42, "status": "placed",  "amount": 99.50},
  "after":  {"order_id": 42, "status": "shipped", "amount": 99.50},
  "source": {"table": "orders", "lsn": 24023128, "ts_ms": 1710496931000},
  "op": "u",
  "ts_ms": 1710496931512
}
```

| `op` | Meaning | `before` | `after` |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| `r` | Snapshot read (initial load) | null | row |
| `c` | Insert | null | row |
| `u` | Update | old row | new row |
| `d` | Delete | old row | null |

**Snapshot then stream:** on first start the connector takes a consistent snapshot of existing rows (`op = r`), then continues from the exact log position where the snapshot ended — no gap and no overlap.

**Operational essentials:** monitor replication slot lag (an unconsumed slot makes the source database retain WAL and can fill its disk) · use Avro/Protobuf with a schema registry · route poison events to a dead-letter topic · plan for connector restarts (offsets are stored in Kafka)

---

## Applying Changes with MERGE

Change events must be applied to a target table so it mirrors the source. The key steps: keep only the **latest change per key** within the batch (ordered by log position), then **merge** — inserting, updating, or deleting.

```sql
MERGE INTO silver.orders AS t
USING (
    SELECT *
    FROM (
        SELECT c.*,
               ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY order_id ORDER BY source_lsn DESC) AS rn
        FROM   bronze.orders_changes c
        WHERE  batch_id = :batch_id
    ) latest
    WHERE rn = 1                                     -- last change per key wins
) AS s
ON t.order_id = s.order_id
WHEN MATCHED AND s.op = 'd' THEN DELETE
WHEN MATCHED AND s.source_lsn > t.source_lsn THEN   -- ignore stale/replayed events
    UPDATE SET status = s.status, amount = s.amount, updated_at = s.updated_at, source_lsn = s.source_lsn
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND s.op <> 'd' THEN
    INSERT (order_id, status, amount, updated_at, source_lsn)
    VALUES (s.order_id, s.status, s.amount, s.updated_at, s.source_lsn);
```

**Why each piece matters**
- *Deduplicate by log position:* one batch may contain several changes to the same row; only the last one counts
- *Compare `source_lsn`:* replays and out-of-order batches can't overwrite newer data — this makes the apply idempotent
- *Handle deletes explicitly:* or choose soft deletes (`is_deleted = true`) when downstream needs history
- *Keep the change log too:* an append-only history table of all events supports audits and SCD Type 2

## Schema Evolution

| Source change | Safe handling |
|---------------|---------------|
| New nullable column | Add it downstream automatically (table formats support schema evolution) |
| Column dropped | Keep the column downstream (NULL going forward); alert |
| Column renamed | Treat as drop + add; requires a mapping decision — alert and block |
| Type widened (int → bigint) | Usually safe to evolve |
| Type narrowed or changed | Block and alert; needs a migration plan |

- Register schemas in a schema registry and set a **compatibility mode** for event topics
- Store the schema version with each raw record
- Agree on **data contracts** with source owners so breaking changes are announced, versioned, and tested before release

---

## Build vs Buy

| Option | Examples | Strengths | Trade-offs |
|--------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Managed ELT connectors | Fivetran, Airbyte Cloud, Stitch, cloud-native connectors | Hundreds of sources, schema handling, no ops | Per-row/usage pricing; less control over edge cases |
| Open-source connectors, self-hosted | Airbyte OSS, Meltano, dlt, Debezium | Control, no per-row fees | You run and upgrade them |
| Cloud database migration/CDC services | AWS DMS, GCP Datastream, Azure Data Factory CDC | Integrated with the cloud; managed CDC | Cloud-specific |
| Custom code | Python + orchestrator | Full control for unusual sources | You own reliability, retries, schema drift |

**Rule of thumb:** buy (or use open-source connectors) for common SaaS sources; use managed or Debezium-based CDC for databases; write custom code only for unusual or high-value sources where the control is worth the maintenance.

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Watermark on `updated_at` with `>` | Rows committed out of order are skipped | `>=` plus a lookback window, and deduplicate downstream |
| Advancing the watermark before the write succeeds | Data permanently skipped after a failed run | Persist the watermark only after a durable write |
| Incremental extracts assumed to capture deletes | Deleted records live forever downstream | CDC, a soft-delete flag, or periodic full reconciliation |
| Offset-based API pagination during an extract | Duplicated or missing records | Cursor-based pagination or a stable sort key |
| Extracting from the primary database | Production slowdowns and angry application teams | Read replicas, snapshots, or log-based CDC |
| Abandoned CDC replication slot | Source database disk fills with retained WAL | Monitor slot lag; drop slots when retiring connectors |
| Applying CDC events without ordering | Older changes overwrite newer ones | Order and compare by log position (LSN/offset) |
| Loading the same file twice | Duplicates after partner re-deliveries | Manifest of processed files with checksums |
| Transforming during ingestion | Can't reprocess when logic was wrong | Land raw data unchanged; transform downstream |
| No freshness or volume monitoring per source | Missing data noticed days later | Alert on last successful load time and row counts per source |

---

## Cheat Sheet

| Situation | Pattern |
|-----------|---------|
| Small reference table | Full extract, overwrite |
| Large table with a reliable `updated_at`, deletes don't matter | Incremental extract + MERGE |
| Operational database, deletes matter or low latency needed | Log-based CDC + MERGE |
| Own application producing events | Publish events to a stream, land append-only |
| Partner files | Event-driven pickup + manifest + quarantine |
| SaaS tool | Managed or open-source connector |

**Raw record metadata:** `_source` · `_ingested_at` · `_batch_id` · `_source_file` or `_source_lsn` · `_schema_version`

**Debezium `op` codes:** `r` snapshot · `c` insert · `u` update · `d` delete

**Idempotency toolkit:** batch folders per run · deterministic record IDs · `MERGE` on keys · compare log positions · manifests for files

## Interview Questions

**Q: What is change data capture and why is log-based CDC preferred?**
A: CDC captures row-level inserts, updates, and deletes from a source database as a stream of change events. Log-based CDC reads the database's transaction log (the Postgres WAL, MySQL binlog) instead of querying tables, so it captures every change including deletes, preserves commit order, provides before-and-after images, and puts almost no load on the source. Query-based approaches miss deletes and intermediate states, and trigger-based approaches slow down every write.

**Q: How do you design an incremental load that doesn't lose or duplicate data?**
A: Use a reliable change column or log position as a watermark, extract with an overlap (`>=` and a lookback window) to catch late commits, write each run to an immutable batch location, and advance the watermark only after the write succeeds. Downstream, deduplicate by primary key and apply with `MERGE` so replays are harmless. Add periodic reconciliation (row counts or checksums against the source) to catch anything the incremental logic misses, such as hard deletes.

**Q: How would you replicate an operational Postgres database into a lakehouse in near real time?**
A: Enable logical replication, run a Debezium Postgres connector that snapshots existing rows and then streams changes to Kafka topics (one per table) with Avro schemas. A streaming job lands the change events append-only in a bronze table, then applies them to silver tables with `MERGE` — the latest change per key by LSN, deletes applied explicitly, and LSN comparison to ignore stale events. Monitor replication slot lag, connector health, and end-to-end freshness, and keep the change history for audits.

**Q: How do you handle schema changes from a source you don't control?**
A: Detect them at ingestion by comparing each batch's schema with the registered one. Let additive changes (new nullable columns) evolve automatically, but block and alert on breaking changes (renames, type narrowing, dropped required fields) rather than silently loading bad data. Store raw data unchanged so you can reprocess once the mapping is fixed, and establish data contracts with the source owners so changes are communicated in advance.

**Q: When would you buy an ingestion tool instead of building one?**
A: For common SaaS sources and standard databases, managed or open-source connectors are usually cheaper than engineering time: they handle pagination, rate limits, schema changes, and API updates across hundreds of sources. Build custom ingestion when the source is unusual, when volume makes per-row pricing prohibitive, or when you need control over latency, security, or data handling that the tools can't provide.
