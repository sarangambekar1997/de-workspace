## Overview

**Challenge:** Traditional databases couple storage and compute on the same servers. Heavy workloads such as month-end reporting slow down every other user, and growing data volumes force larger servers whether or not more compute is needed.

**Solution:** Snowflake is a cloud data warehouse that keeps data in a single central store and runs queries on independent compute clusters ("virtual warehouses"). Loading, transformation, BI, and data science workloads each receive their own compute, do not contend with one another, and suspend automatically when idle.

```

```

**Additional capabilities:** standard SQL with useful extensions (`QUALIFY`, `FLATTEN`), native semi-structured data handling, time travel for recovering from mistakes, zero-copy cloning for development environments, and minimal tuning — no indexes or vacuuming.

## Architecture

Snowflake separates storage, compute, and cloud services into three independent layers.

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Cloud Services Layer               │
│  (authentication, optimizer, metadata,      │
│   security, query compilation)              │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────┴───────────────────────────┐
│          Query Processing Layer             │
│   Warehouse A    Warehouse B    Warehouse C │
│   (XS)           (M)            (L)         │
│   own CPU/RAM    own CPU/RAM    own CPU/RAM │
└─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┘
                  │
┌─────────────────┴───────────────────────────┐
│          Database Storage Layer             │
│   (compressed columnar files in S3/Azure   │
│    Blob / GCS — decoupled from compute)    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight:** compute (virtual warehouses) and storage are completely decoupled.
- Multiple warehouses can read the same data simultaneously
- Warehouses can be paused without losing data
- Storage costs and compute costs scale independently

---

## Key Concepts

| Concept | What it is |
|---------|-----------|
| **Virtual Warehouse** | A cluster of compute nodes (CPU + RAM); runs queries; billed per second when active |
| **Credit** | Snowflake's billing unit; 1 credit = 1 hour of 1 XS warehouse |
| **Micro-partition** | Immutable ~50–500 MB columnar files; Snowflake's internal storage unit |
| **Metadata Store** | Stores min/max values, row counts per micro-partition — enables pruning |
| **Result Cache** | Query results cached 24h; identical query returns instantly at zero cost |
| **Time Travel** | Access historical data up to 90 days back |
| **Fail-safe** | 7-day disaster recovery window (not queryable — Snowflake support only) |
| **Stage** | Named location for data files: internal (Snowflake-managed) or external (your S3/GCS/ADLS) |
| **Snowpipe** | Continuous, serverless ingestion from a stage — triggers on file arrival |
| **Stream** | CDC table — tracks inserts/updates/deletes since the last consumption |
| **Task** | Scheduled SQL or stored procedure; Snowflake's built-in scheduler |
| **Share** | Share live data with another Snowflake account without copying it |

## Databases, Schemas & Tables

```sql
-- Database
CREATE DATABASE analytics;
USE DATABASE analytics;

-- Schema
CREATE SCHEMA analytics.staging;
CREATE SCHEMA analytics.marts;
USE SCHEMA analytics.staging;

-- Fully qualified name: database.schema.table
SELECT * FROM analytics.marts.dim_customer;

-- Table
CREATE TABLE staging.orders (
    order_id     VARCHAR(36)    NOT NULL,
    customer_id  INTEGER        NOT NULL,
    amount       NUMBER(12, 2),
    status       VARCHAR(20),
    created_at   TIMESTAMP_NTZ,           -- no timezone
    updated_at   TIMESTAMP_LTZ            -- local timezone
);

-- Create table from query
CREATE TABLE marts.order_summary AS
SELECT DATE(created_at) AS order_date, SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM   staging.orders
GROUP  BY 1;

-- Transient table — no fail-safe (lower cost; use for staging/temp data)
CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE staging.raw_orders (...);

-- Temporary table — session-scoped, auto-dropped
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temp_work AS SELECT ...;

-- External table — query files directly on S3 without loading
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE raw.orders_ext (
    order_id  VARCHAR AS (VALUE:order_id::VARCHAR),
    amount    FLOAT   AS (VALUE:amount::FLOAT)
)
WITH LOCATION = @my_s3_stage/orders/
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = PARQUET);
```

## Data Types

| Category | Type | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| Numeric | `NUMBER(p,s)`, `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE` | `NUMBER` is exact; use for money |
| String | `VARCHAR(n)`, `STRING`, `TEXT` | All stored as UTF-8; max 16 MB |
| Date/Time | `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP_NTZ`, `TIMESTAMP_LTZ`, `TIMESTAMP_TZ` | NTZ = no timezone, LTZ = local, TZ = with offset |
| Boolean | `BOOLEAN` | `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL` |
| Semi-structured | `VARIANT`, `ARRAY`, `OBJECT` | Store any JSON/XML/Avro |
| Geospatial | `GEOGRAPHY`, `GEOMETRY` | For spatial queries |

```sql
-- VARIANT — stores any JSON value
CREATE TABLE events (
    event_id  INTEGER,
    payload   VARIANT    -- can hold any JSON structure
);

INSERT INTO events VALUES (1, PARSE_JSON('{"type":"click","page":"home","user":42}'));

-- Query VARIANT fields
SELECT payload:type::STRING      AS event_type,
       payload:user::INTEGER     AS user_id,
       payload:page::STRING      AS page
FROM   events;
```

---

## Querying Data

Snowflake supports standard SQL plus many extensions. All SQL reference patterns apply here.

```sql
-- Standard SELECT (see sql-reference.md for full SQL coverage)
SELECT order_id, amount, status
FROM   staging.orders
WHERE  created_at >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
ORDER  BY created_at DESC
LIMIT  100;

-- Snowflake-specific: QUALIFY — filter window function results inline
SELECT name, dept, salary,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
FROM employees
QUALIFY rnk <= 3;    -- top 3 per department without a subquery

-- PIVOT
SELECT *
FROM   monthly_revenue
PIVOT (SUM(revenue) FOR month IN ('Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar')) AS p;

-- UNPIVOT
SELECT product, month, revenue
FROM   quarterly_data
UNPIVOT (revenue FOR month IN (jan, feb, mar));

-- FLATTEN — expand ARRAY or OBJECT into rows
SELECT f.value::STRING AS tag
FROM   products,
       LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => tags) f;

-- SAMPLE — random sample
SELECT * FROM orders SAMPLE (10);            -- 10% random
SELECT * FROM orders SAMPLE (1000 ROWS);     -- exactly 1000 rows
```

---

## Loading Data

### Stages

```sql
-- Internal stage — Snowflake-managed storage
CREATE STAGE my_internal_stage
    FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = CSV FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"' SKIP_HEADER = 1);

-- External stage — your S3 bucket, authenticated via a storage integration
-- (an IAM role Snowflake assumes — no access keys stored in Snowflake)
CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION s3_int
    TYPE = EXTERNAL_STAGE
    STORAGE_PROVIDER = 'S3'
    ENABLED = TRUE
    STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN = 'arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/snowflake-s3-read'
    STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = ('s3://my-bucket/data/');
-- DESC INTEGRATION s3_int;  → copy the IAM user ARN + external ID into the role's trust policy

CREATE STAGE my_s3_stage
    URL = 's3://my-bucket/data/'
    STORAGE_INTEGRATION = s3_int
    FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = PARQUET);

-- List files in a stage
LIST @my_s3_stage;

-- Upload a local file to internal stage (SnowSQL CLI)
PUT file:///local/path/orders.csv @my_internal_stage;
```

### COPY INTO — batch load

```sql
-- Load from stage into table
COPY INTO staging.orders
FROM @my_s3_stage/orders/2024/03/
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = PARQUET)
MATCH_BY_COLUMN_NAME = CASE_INSENSITIVE
ON_ERROR = 'SKIP_FILE';    -- ABORT_STATEMENT | CONTINUE | SKIP_FILE

-- Load CSV with options
COPY INTO staging.customers
FROM @my_s3_stage/customers/
FILE_FORMAT = (
    TYPE = CSV
    SKIP_HEADER = 1
    FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY = '"'
    DATE_FORMAT = 'YYYY-MM-DD'
    TIMESTAMP_FORMAT = 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS'
)
PURGE = TRUE;     -- delete files from stage after successful load

-- Validate before loading (dry run)
COPY INTO staging.orders
FROM @my_s3_stage/orders/
VALIDATION_MODE = 'RETURN_ERRORS';

-- Check load history
SELECT *
FROM   information_schema.load_history
WHERE  table_name = 'ORDERS'
ORDER  BY last_load_time DESC
LIMIT  10;
```

### Snowpipe — continuous ingestion

```sql
-- Create a pipe pointing to a stage and target table
CREATE PIPE orders_pipe
    AUTO_INGEST = TRUE   -- triggered by S3 event notifications
AS
COPY INTO staging.orders
FROM @my_s3_stage/orders/
FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = PARQUET);

-- Check pipe status
SELECT SYSTEM$PIPE_STATUS('orders_pipe');

-- Manually trigger for specific files
ALTER PIPE orders_pipe REFRESH
    PREFIX = 'orders/2024/03/15/';
```

---

## Virtual Warehouses

```sql
-- Create a warehouse
CREATE WAREHOUSE analytics_wh
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'         -- XS, S, M, L, XL, 2XL, 3XL, 4XL, 5XL, 6XL
    AUTO_SUSPEND = 120                -- auto-suspend after 120 seconds of inactivity
    AUTO_RESUME = TRUE                -- auto-resume when a query arrives
    MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 3             -- multi-cluster: scale out to 3 clusters
    MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1             -- scale back to 1 when load drops
    SCALING_POLICY = 'STANDARD';      -- STANDARD | ECONOMY

-- Use a warehouse
USE WAREHOUSE analytics_wh;

-- Resize on the fly (takes effect immediately for new queries)
ALTER WAREHOUSE analytics_wh SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'LARGE';

-- Suspend / resume manually
ALTER WAREHOUSE analytics_wh SUSPEND;
ALTER WAREHOUSE analytics_wh RESUME;

-- Warehouse sizes and credits/hour
-- XS=1  S=2  M=4  L=8  XL=16  2XL=32  3XL=64  4XL=128
```

### Multi-cluster warehouses

Multi-cluster allows a warehouse to spin up additional clusters when queued queries exceed a threshold. Solves concurrency bottlenecks without resizing.

```sql
CREATE WAREHOUSE reporting_wh
    WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM'
    MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 5     -- up to 5 parallel clusters
    MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1     -- always at least 1 running
    SCALING_POLICY = 'ECONOMY';  -- wait longer before spinning up extra cluster
                                 -- STANDARD scales aggressively
```

---

## Semi-Structured Data

Snowflake's `VARIANT` type stores any JSON, Avro, Parquet, or XML natively.

```sql
-- Dot notation to traverse JSON
SELECT
    payload:user_id::INTEGER         AS user_id,
    payload:event.type::STRING       AS event_type,
    payload:items[0].sku::STRING     AS first_sku,   -- array index
    payload:metadata:source::STRING  AS source
FROM events;

-- FLATTEN — turn array into rows
SELECT
    order_id,
    f.value:sku::STRING     AS sku,
    f.value:quantity::INT   AS qty
FROM orders,
     LATERAL FLATTEN(INPUT => line_items) f;

-- Check if a key exists
SELECT * FROM events WHERE payload:user_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Parse JSON string into VARIANT
SELECT PARSE_JSON('{"key": "value"}'):key::STRING;

-- Convert VARIANT back to string
SELECT payload::STRING FROM events;

-- Build a VARIANT from columns
SELECT OBJECT_CONSTRUCT('id', id, 'name', name) AS json_row
FROM customers;
```

---

## Time Travel

Query, clone, or restore data from any point in the past (up to 90 days for Enterprise edition).

```sql
-- Query table as it was 1 hour ago
SELECT * FROM orders AT (OFFSET => -3600);   -- seconds

-- Query at a specific timestamp
SELECT * FROM orders AT (TIMESTAMP => '2024-03-14 09:00:00'::TIMESTAMP);

-- Query before a specific statement executed
SELECT * FROM orders BEFORE (STATEMENT => '01b48fd2-0001-b7b8-...');

-- Restore a dropped table
UNDROP TABLE staging.orders;

-- Restore a table to a prior state (create from time travel, then swap)
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders_restored
    CLONE orders AT (TIMESTAMP => '2024-03-14 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP);

-- Set retention period (default 1 day for Standard, up to 90 for Enterprise)
ALTER TABLE orders SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 7;
```

---

## Cloning

Zero-copy cloning creates an independent copy of a table, schema, or database instantly — no data is physically copied until one side modifies it.

```sql
-- Clone a table (instant, zero storage cost initially)
CREATE TABLE orders_backup CLONE orders;

-- Clone a schema (clones all objects within it)
CREATE SCHEMA staging_backup CLONE staging;

-- Clone a database
CREATE DATABASE analytics_dev CLONE analytics;

-- Clone at a point in time (useful for dev/test environments)
CREATE DATABASE analytics_dev CLONE analytics
    AT (TIMESTAMP => '2024-03-01 00:00:00'::TIMESTAMP);
```

> Cloning is the standard way to create dev/test environments in Snowflake. Clone production, work in the clone, discard when done — no cost until data diverges.

---

## Streams & Tasks

### Streams — CDC on tables

A stream tracks all DML changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to a table since it was last consumed.

```sql
-- Create a stream on a source table
CREATE STREAM orders_stream ON TABLE staging.raw_orders;

-- Query the stream — see what changed
SELECT *,
    METADATA$ACTION,        -- INSERT or DELETE
    METADATA$ISUPDATE,      -- true if part of an UPDATE (appears as DELETE + INSERT)
    METADATA$ROW_ID
FROM orders_stream;

-- Consume the stream in a merge (marks it as consumed)
MERGE INTO marts.orders AS target
USING (
    SELECT * FROM orders_stream WHERE METADATA$ACTION = 'INSERT'
) AS source ON target.order_id = source.order_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET target.amount = source.amount,
                              target.status = source.status
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT VALUES (source.order_id, source.amount, source.status);
-- After this executes, orders_stream resets — only shows new changes going forward

-- Check if a stream has unconsumed data
SELECT SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA('orders_stream');
```

### Tasks — scheduled SQL

```sql
-- Create a task that runs every hour
CREATE TASK refresh_summary
    WAREHOUSE = analytics_wh
    SCHEDULE = 'USING CRON 0 * * * * UTC'
AS
INSERT INTO marts.hourly_summary
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('hour', created_at) AS hour,
       COUNT(*) AS orders, SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM   staging.orders
WHERE  created_at >= DATEADD(hour, -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP  BY 1;

-- Tasks start suspended — resume to activate
ALTER TASK refresh_summary RESUME;

-- Task chain — run task B after task A completes
CREATE TASK transform_task
    AFTER extract_task        -- no SCHEDULE needed, triggered by parent
AS
    CALL transform_proc();

-- View task history
SELECT *
FROM   TABLE(information_schema.task_history())
ORDER  BY scheduled_time DESC
LIMIT  20;
```

---

## Query Performance

### Query Profile

The most important performance tool. Open any query result → Query Profile to see:
- Execution time per node
- Bytes scanned vs pruned
- Spill to disk (means warehouse is too small for the query)
- The most expensive step

### Micro-partition pruning

Snowflake stores metadata (min/max values, row count) for each micro-partition. Filters on those columns skip entire partitions without reading them.

```sql
-- This can skip most partitions if created_at has good min/max range
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE created_at >= '2024-03-01';

-- SHOW TABLES includes partition stats
SHOW TABLES LIKE 'orders';

-- Check how well a query prunes
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = 'abc123';
-- Check Query Profile: "Partitions scanned" vs "Partitions total"
-- Good: 1/10000 partitions scanned
-- Bad:  10000/10000 partitions scanned (full scan — consider clustering)
```

### Result cache

```sql
-- Identical query returns instantly from cache (0 credits used)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
-- Run again — "result reused" in Query Profile

-- Disable result cache for benchmarking
ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;

-- Cache lives in the cloud services layer — reused across users and warehouses
-- when the query text is identical and the role can access the tables
-- Invalidated when underlying data changes (or after 24h without reuse)
```

---

## Clustering Keys

When queries consistently filter on a high-cardinality column but partition pruning is poor, define a clustering key. Snowflake will physically reorganize micro-partitions so filtered ranges are co-located.

```sql
-- Add a clustering key
ALTER TABLE orders CLUSTER BY (DATE(created_at));

-- Multi-column clustering
ALTER TABLE events CLUSTER BY (user_id, DATE(event_time));

-- Check clustering depth (lower = better; >6 means recluster)
SELECT SYSTEM$CLUSTERING_INFORMATION('orders', '(DATE(created_at))');

-- Reclustering is automatic (Automatic Clustering service, billed in credits)
-- Pause / resume it per table to control cost
ALTER TABLE orders SUSPEND RECLUSTER;
ALTER TABLE orders RESUME RECLUSTER;

-- Drop a clustering key
ALTER TABLE orders DROP CLUSTERING KEY;
```

> Use clustering only when:
> - The table is very large (>1 TB)
> - Queries consistently filter on the same column(s)
> - Query Profile shows poor partition pruning

---

## Cost Management

```sql
-- Credit usage by warehouse (last 30 days)
SELECT warehouse_name,
       SUM(credits_used) AS total_credits,
       ROUND(SUM(credits_used) * 3.0, 2) AS estimated_usd   -- ~$3/credit on-demand
FROM   snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history
WHERE  start_time >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP  BY 1
ORDER  BY 2 DESC;

-- Query cost — bytes scanned and execution time
SELECT query_id, query_text, warehouse_name,
       execution_time / 1000 AS seconds,
       bytes_scanned / 1e9   AS gb_scanned,
       credits_used_cloud_services
FROM   snowflake.account_usage.query_history
WHERE  start_time >= DATEADD(day, -1, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
ORDER  BY credits_used_cloud_services DESC
LIMIT  20;

-- Storage costs
SELECT TABLE_SCHEMA, TABLE_NAME,
       ROUND(ACTIVE_BYTES / 1e9, 2)         AS active_gb,
       ROUND(TIME_TRAVEL_BYTES / 1e9, 2)    AS time_travel_gb,
       ROUND(FAILSAFE_BYTES / 1e9, 2)       AS failsafe_gb
FROM   snowflake.account_usage.table_storage_metrics
ORDER  BY active_gb DESC
LIMIT  20;
```

### Cost reduction patterns

```sql
-- 1. Ensure warehouses auto-suspend
ALTER WAREHOUSE my_wh SET AUTO_SUSPEND = 60;   -- 60 second idle timeout

-- 2. Use transient tables for staging (no fail-safe cost)
CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE staging.raw_orders (...);

-- 3. Reduce time travel on large tables that don't need it
ALTER TABLE staging.raw_orders SET DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS = 0;

-- 4. Query result cache is free — don't disable it in production

-- 5. Use COPY INTO over INSERT for bulk loads (more efficient)

-- 6. Right-size warehouses — profile queries before scaling up
```

---

## Access Control & RBAC

Snowflake uses role-based access control (RBAC). Everything is granted to a role, and users are assigned roles.

```sql
-- Create roles
CREATE ROLE analyst;
CREATE ROLE data_engineer;
CREATE ROLE loader;

-- Grant privileges to roles
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE analytics          TO ROLE analyst;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA analytics.marts     TO ROLE analyst;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA analytics.marts TO ROLE analyst;
GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA analytics.marts TO ROLE analyst;

GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA analytics.staging TO ROLE data_engineer;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE analytics_wh  TO ROLE analyst;
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE transform_wh  TO ROLE data_engineer;

-- Create user and assign role
CREATE USER alice
    PASSWORD = 'strong_password'
    DEFAULT_ROLE = analyst
    DEFAULT_WAREHOUSE = analytics_wh;

GRANT ROLE analyst TO USER alice;

-- Role hierarchy — grant role to another role
GRANT ROLE analyst TO ROLE data_engineer;   -- engineers inherit analyst privileges

-- Show grants
SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE analyst;
SHOW GRANTS TO USER alice;
SHOW GRANTS ON TABLE orders;
```

---

## Snowflake-Specific SQL

```sql
-- QUALIFY — filter window results without a subquery
SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY dept ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk
FROM employees
QUALIFY rnk = 1;    -- highest earner per department

-- IFF — shorthand CASE WHEN for single condition
SELECT IFF(amount > 1000, 'large', 'small') AS order_size FROM orders;

-- ZEROIFNULL / NULLIFZERO
SELECT ZEROIFNULL(revenue) FROM report;   -- NULL → 0
SELECT NULLIFZERO(quantity) FROM items;  -- 0 → NULL

-- DATE_TRUNC
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', created_at) AS month, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY 1;
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('week',  event_time) AS week,  COUNT(*) FROM events  GROUP BY 1;

-- DATEADD / DATEDIFF
SELECT DATEADD('day', -7, CURRENT_DATE());
SELECT DATEDIFF('day', hire_date, CURRENT_DATE()) AS tenure_days FROM employees;

-- TO_CHAR — format a date as string
SELECT TO_CHAR(created_at, 'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') FROM orders;

-- TRY_CAST — safe cast, returns NULL on failure
SELECT TRY_CAST(raw_amount AS NUMBER(12,2)) FROM raw_data;

-- GENERATOR — generate a sequence of rows (useful for date spine)
SELECT DATEADD(day, SEQ4(), '2024-01-01'::DATE) AS cal_date
FROM   TABLE(GENERATOR(ROWCOUNT => 365));

-- LISTAGG — concatenate values within a group
SELECT dept, LISTAGG(name, ', ') WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY name) AS employees
FROM   employees
GROUP  BY dept;

-- ARRAY_AGG and OBJECT_AGG
SELECT dept,
    ARRAY_AGG(name)        AS name_array,
    OBJECT_AGG(name, salary) AS name_salary_map
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept;
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Warehouses with long (or no) `AUTO_SUSPEND` | Credits burn all night with nothing running | `AUTO_SUSPEND = 60` for most warehouses; set resource monitors with credit quotas |
| One big shared warehouse for everything | ETL and dashboards slow each other down; you can't attribute cost | Separate warehouses per workload (load / transform / BI / ad hoc) |
| Scaling *up* to fix concurrency (or *out* to fix a slow query) | Cost rises but the problem doesn't go away | Slow single query → larger size; many queued queries → multi-cluster |
| Wrapping filtered columns in functions (`WHERE TO_DATE(ts) = ...`) | Poor pruning — scans every micro-partition | Filter on the raw column with a range; cluster on the expression if you must |
| Clustering keys on small or rarely filtered tables | Automatic Clustering credits with no speed-up | Only for multi-TB tables with consistent filters and poor pruning in the Query Profile |
| `TIMESTAMP_LTZ` / `NTZ` mixed carelessly | Values shift by hours depending on the session timezone | Store UTC in `TIMESTAMP_NTZ` (or use `TIMESTAMP_TZ`), and set the account timezone explicitly |
| Access keys in stage definitions | Long-lived credentials inside Snowflake | Storage integrations (IAM role assumption) |
| Password-only service users | Blocked or flagged as Snowflake enforces MFA and phases out single-factor passwords | Key-pair auth (or OAuth) for service/pipeline users |
| Granting to users instead of roles; using `ACCOUNTADMIN` day to day | Permission sprawl, risky mistakes | RBAC hierarchy: access roles → functional roles → users; `SYSADMIN` for objects, `ACCOUNTADMIN` locked down |
| Forgetting `FUTURE` grants | New tables created by dbt are invisible to analysts | `GRANT SELECT ON FUTURE TABLES IN SCHEMA ...` |
| Consuming a stream in a task that fails midway | Assuming changes were lost (or processed twice) | A stream only advances when the DML that reads it commits; wrap consumption in a single transaction |
| Big `SELECT *` over wide VARIANT data | Slow and expensive | Flatten frequently used JSON paths into typed columns in Silver |

**Warehouse sizing:** each size step doubles credits/hour (XS=1, S=2, M=4, L=8, XL=16…) and roughly halves the runtime of queries that parallelize well — so a bigger warehouse can cost the same while finishing faster.

**Table types:** permanent (time travel + 7-day fail-safe) · transient (no fail-safe — staging) · temporary (session only) · external (query files in place) · Iceberg (open format in your own bucket)

## Interview Questions

**Q: Explain Snowflake's architecture.**
A: Three independent layers. Storage: data is kept as compressed, columnar, immutable micro-partitions in cloud object storage. Compute: virtual warehouses — independent clusters that read that storage, scale up (size) or out (multi-cluster), and suspend when idle, billed per second. Cloud services: authentication, metadata, the optimizer, transactions, and the result cache. Because storage and compute are separate, many workloads can query the same data concurrently without contention, and each scales and is billed independently.

**Q: What are micro-partitions and how does pruning work?**
A: Snowflake automatically splits tables into immutable micro-partitions (~50–500 MB uncompressed) and records metadata for each — min/max values per column, distinct counts, and null counts. At query time the optimizer compares filter predicates against that metadata and skips partitions that can't match. Pruning works best when data is naturally ordered by the filter column (e.g. loaded by date); a clustering key can restore that order for large tables with a different access pattern.

**Q: When would you scale a warehouse up versus out?**
A: Scale *up* (a larger size) when individual queries are slow or spill to disk — more memory and CPU per query. Scale *out* (multi-cluster) when many concurrent queries are queuing — more clusters serve more users, but no single query gets faster. The Query Profile shows spilling; warehouse load history shows queuing.

**Q: What are Streams and Tasks, and how do they work together?**
A: A stream is a change-tracking object on a table: it records inserts, updates, and deletes since it was last consumed, using an offset rather than a copy of the data. A task runs SQL on a schedule or after another task. Together they form an in-Snowflake incremental pipeline: a task (optionally gated on `SYSTEM$STREAM_HAS_DATA`) `MERGE`s the stream's changes into a target, and the stream's offset advances when that transaction commits. Dynamic tables are the newer, declarative alternative for many of these cases.

**Q: What is the difference between Time Travel and Fail-safe?**
A: Time Travel lets *you* query, clone, or restore data as it was at an earlier point — 1 day by default, up to 90 days on Enterprise — using `AT`/`BEFORE` and `UNDROP`. Fail-safe is a further 7-day window after Time Travel expires, recoverable only by Snowflake support, meant for disasters. Both add storage cost, which is why transient tables (no fail-safe) are used for staging.

**Q: How does zero-copy cloning work and what is it used for?**
A: A clone copies metadata only — the new object points to the same micro-partitions as the source, so it's instant and initially free. Once either side changes data, only the changed micro-partitions are stored separately. It's used for dev/test environments cloned from production, backups before risky migrations, and CI databases for dbt PRs.

**Q: How would you control Snowflake costs?**
A: Auto-suspend every warehouse (60 seconds is typical), right-size per workload and separate workloads for attribution, set resource monitors with quotas, use transient tables and shorter retention for staging, avoid unnecessary clustering, and let the result cache work. Then monitor `ACCOUNT_USAGE` views (`WAREHOUSE_METERING_HISTORY`, `QUERY_HISTORY`) for the most expensive queries and fix those — usually poor pruning, exploding joins, or full refreshes that should be incremental.

**Q: How do you load data into Snowflake?**
A: Batch with `COPY INTO` from a stage (internal, or external S3/GCS/Azure using a storage integration). It tracks load metadata so files aren't loaded twice. For continuous loading, Snowpipe auto-ingests files as cloud event notifications arrive, and Snowpipe Streaming ingests rows directly (e.g. from the Kafka connector) without files. Managed tools (Fivetran, Airbyte) sit on top of these mechanisms.
