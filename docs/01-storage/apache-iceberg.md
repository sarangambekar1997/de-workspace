## Plain English

**What is Apache Iceberg?**

Imagine your data lake is a folder of Parquet files on S3. The problem: there's no "table" — just files. You can't do `UPDATE`, you can't roll back a bad write, and two jobs writing at the same time corrupt each other.

Iceberg is a **table format** that wraps those files with a metadata layer. It tracks which files belong to the table, what schema they have, and what changed when. The files stay on S3 — Iceberg just adds structure on top.

```
Without Iceberg:          With Iceberg:
s3://bucket/orders/       iceberg table "orders"
  2024-03-15.parquet        ├── metadata/ (schema, snapshots, history)
  2024-03-16.parquet        └── data/     (the same Parquet files)
  2024-03-17.parquet
  (just files — no table)   (a real table with ACID, history, evolution)
```

**Why Iceberg over Delta Lake?**
- Delta Lake is Databricks-native; Iceberg is truly open — Spark, Flink, Trino, Snowflake, and BigQuery all read it natively
- Choose Iceberg when your data sits in a multi-engine environment; Delta when you're all-in on Databricks

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Plain English |
|---------|--------------|
| **Table format** | A specification for how to organize data files and metadata so any engine can read the "table" | 
| **Snapshot** | A point-in-time version of the table — every write creates a new snapshot |
| **Manifest** | A file listing all data files in a snapshot with their statistics |
| **Catalog** | A service that maps table names to their metadata location (Hive Metastore, AWS Glue, Nessie, REST) |
| **Hidden partitioning** | Iceberg handles partition transforms automatically — no more `dt=2024-03-15` folder names in queries |
| **Metadata evolution** | Add, rename, or drop columns without rewriting data |

```
Iceberg metadata hierarchy:
  Table  (name → metadata pointer)
    └── Metadata file  (schema, partition spec, current snapshot)
          └── Snapshot (list of manifest files)
                └── Manifest (list of data files + stats)
                      └── Data file  (actual Parquet/ORC/Avro)
```

## Setup with PySpark

```python
# pip install 'pyspark==3.5.*'
# No Iceberg pip package needed — the runtime jar below is downloaded by Spark.
# Its name must match your Spark (3.5) and Scala (2.12) versions.

from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("iceberg-demo") \
    .config("spark.jars.packages",
            "org.apache.iceberg:iceberg-spark-runtime-3.5_2.12:1.5.0") \
    .config("spark.sql.extensions",
            "org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions") \
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.local",
            "org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog") \
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.local.type", "hadoop") \
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.local.warehouse", "/tmp/iceberg-warehouse") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

```python
# AWS Glue catalog (production setup)
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.glue_catalog",
            "org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog") \
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.glue_catalog.warehouse",
            "s3://my-bucket/iceberg/") \
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.glue_catalog.catalog-impl",
            "org.apache.iceberg.aws.glue.GlueCatalog") \
    .config("spark.sql.catalog.glue_catalog.io-impl",
            "org.apache.iceberg.aws.s3.S3FileIO") \
    .getOrCreate()
```

## Creating and Writing Tables

```python
from pyspark.sql import functions as F

# Create an Iceberg table via SQL
spark.sql("""
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS local.db.orders (
        order_id     STRING,
        customer_id  STRING,
        amount       DOUBLE,
        status       STRING,
        order_date   DATE
    )
    USING iceberg
    PARTITIONED BY (order_date)
    TBLPROPERTIES (
        'format-version'           = '2',
        'write.format.default'     = 'parquet',
        'write.target-file-size-bytes' = '134217728'  -- 128MB
    )
""")

# Write via DataFrame
df = spark.createDataFrame([
    ("ORD-001", "CUST-1", 99.99,  "placed",    "2024-03-15"),
    ("ORD-002", "CUST-2", 149.50, "shipped",   "2024-03-15"),
    ("ORD-003", "CUST-1", 29.00,  "delivered", "2024-03-16"),
], ["order_id", "customer_id", "amount", "status", "order_date"])

df = df.withColumn("order_date", F.col("order_date").cast("date"))

# Append (default)
df.writeTo("local.db.orders").append()

# Overwrite a specific partition
df.writeTo("local.db.orders") \
  .overwritePartitions()

# Full overwrite
df.writeTo("local.db.orders").overwrite(F.lit(True))
```

---

## Reading Data

```python
# Read the current snapshot
df = spark.table("local.db.orders")
df.show()

# Via SQL
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM local.db.orders WHERE status = 'placed'").show()

# Check table metadata
spark.sql("DESCRIBE EXTENDED local.db.orders").show(truncate=False)

# Show snapshots (history)
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM local.db.orders.snapshots").show()

# Show data files
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM local.db.orders.files").show()

# Show history
spark.sql("SELECT * FROM local.db.orders.history").show()
```

---

## Schema Evolution

```python
# Add a column (non-breaking)
spark.sql("ALTER TABLE local.db.orders ADD COLUMN shipping_cost DOUBLE")

# Rename a column
spark.sql("ALTER TABLE local.db.orders RENAME COLUMN shipping_cost TO shipping_fee")

# Change a column type — only safe widenings: int → long, float → double,
# decimal(P,S) → decimal(P+n,S). DOUBLE → DECIMAL is NOT allowed.
spark.sql("ALTER TABLE local.db.orders ADD COLUMN quantity INT")
spark.sql("ALTER TABLE local.db.orders ALTER COLUMN quantity TYPE BIGINT")

# Drop a column (data still in files, just not exposed in schema)
spark.sql("ALTER TABLE local.db.orders DROP COLUMN shipping_fee")

# After schema changes, old data files still work — Iceberg handles nulls for
# missing columns automatically

# Schema evolution rules:
# ✓  Adding columns      — always safe
# ✓  Dropping columns    — safe (data stays, not visible)
# ✓  Renaming columns    — safe (tracked by column ID, not name)
# ✓  Widening types      — safe (int→long, float→double)
# ✗  Narrowing types     — NOT allowed (double→float loses precision)
# ✗  Changing semantics  — NOT safe (renaming to mean something different)
```

## Partitioning

Iceberg's hidden partitioning is one of its best features — no `WHERE dt='2024-03-15'` needed.

```python
# Partition transforms — Iceberg applies these automatically at write time
spark.sql("""
    CREATE TABLE local.db.events (
        event_id   STRING,
        user_id    STRING,
        event_type STRING,
        event_ts   TIMESTAMP,
        amount     DOUBLE
    )
    USING iceberg
    PARTITIONED BY (
        days(event_ts),        -- partition by day from a timestamp
        bucket(16, user_id)    -- hash into 16 buckets (for high-cardinality cols)
    )
""")

# Available transforms:
# year(ts)      → YYYY
# month(ts)     → YYYY-MM
# days(ts)      → YYYY-MM-DD   (most common)
# hours(ts)     → YYYY-MM-DD-HH
# bucket(N, col) → hash into N buckets
# truncate(N, col) → string prefix or integer truncation

# Writing — Iceberg handles partitioning transparently
df.writeTo("local.db.events").append()

# Querying — no partition filter needed in WHERE; Iceberg prunes automatically
spark.sql("""
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM local.db.events
    WHERE event_ts BETWEEN '2024-03-01' AND '2024-03-15'
""").show()
# Iceberg reads only the day=2024-03-01 through day=2024-03-15 partitions

# Evolve the partition spec without rewriting data
spark.sql("ALTER TABLE local.db.events ADD PARTITION FIELD hours(event_ts)")
spark.sql("ALTER TABLE local.db.events DROP PARTITION FIELD days(event_ts)")
```

---

## Time Travel

```python
# Query a specific snapshot
spark.sql("""
    SELECT * FROM local.db.orders
    VERSION AS OF 1234567890  -- snapshot ID
""").show()

# Query at a specific timestamp
spark.sql("""
    SELECT * FROM local.db.orders
    TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-03-15 12:00:00'
""").show()

# Via DataFrame reader
df = spark.read \
    .option("snapshot-id", "1234567890") \
    .table("local.db.orders")

df = spark.read \
    .option("as-of-timestamp", "1710504000000") \
    .table("local.db.orders")          # as-of-timestamp is milliseconds since epoch

# Rollback to a previous snapshot
spark.sql("CALL local.system.rollback_to_snapshot('db.orders', 1234567890)")

# Rollback to a timestamp
spark.sql("CALL local.system.rollback_to_timestamp('db.orders', TIMESTAMP '2024-03-14 00:00:00')")
```

---

## ACID Operations

```python
# MERGE (upsert) — insert new, update existing
spark.sql("""
    MERGE INTO local.db.orders t
    USING updates s ON t.order_id = s.order_id
    WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET t.status = s.status, t.amount = s.amount
    WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *
""")

# UPDATE
spark.sql("""
    UPDATE local.db.orders
    SET status = 'cancelled'
    WHERE order_date < '2024-01-01' AND status = 'placed'
""")

# DELETE
spark.sql("""
    DELETE FROM local.db.orders
    WHERE status = 'cancelled' AND order_date < '2023-01-01'
""")

# Copy-on-write (default) vs Merge-on-read:
# Copy-on-write: rewrites entire files on every update/delete — fast reads, slow writes
# Merge-on-read: writes delete files; merges at read time — fast writes, slower reads
spark.sql("""
    ALTER TABLE local.db.orders
    SET TBLPROPERTIES ('write.delete.mode' = 'merge-on-read')
""")
```

---

## Table Maintenance

```python
# Expire old snapshots (reclaim storage)
spark.sql("""
    CALL local.system.expire_snapshots(
        table         => 'db.orders',
        older_than    => TIMESTAMP '2024-03-01 00:00:00',
        retain_last   => 5
    )
""")

# Remove orphan files (files not referenced by any snapshot)
spark.sql("""
    CALL local.system.remove_orphan_files(table => 'db.orders')
""")

# Compact small files (rewrite into larger files)
spark.sql("""
    CALL local.system.rewrite_data_files(
        table   => 'db.orders',
        options => map('target-file-size-bytes', '134217728')
    )
""")

# Rewrite manifests (improves planning performance on large tables)
spark.sql("""
    CALL local.system.rewrite_manifests(table => 'db.orders')
""")
```

---

## Iceberg on AWS (Glue + Athena)

```python
# AWS Glue Catalog + S3 + Athena — no Spark cluster needed for queries

# Create the table with Athena DDL — Athena writes the Iceberg metadata and
# registers the table in the Glue Data Catalog in one step:
#
# CREATE TABLE mydb.orders (
#     order_id    string,
#     customer_id string,
#     amount      double,
#     order_date  date
# )
# PARTITIONED BY (day(order_date))
# LOCATION 's3://my-bucket/iceberg/orders/'
# TBLPROPERTIES ('table_type' = 'ICEBERG');
#
# Tables created by Spark with the Glue catalog (setup above) show up in Athena
# automatically — both engines share the same Glue metadata.

# Query in Athena (after table registered in Glue)
# SELECT * FROM mydb.orders WHERE order_date >= DATE '2024-03-01'

# Athena time travel
# SELECT * FROM mydb.orders FOR SYSTEM_TIME AS OF TIMESTAMP '2024-03-15 12:00:00'
```

## Common Mistakes

```
1. Forgetting to configure a catalog
   Problem: Iceberg tables need a catalog — without one, nothing persists
   Fix:     Always configure Hive Metastore, AWS Glue, or Nessie catalog in SparkSession

2. Not running table maintenance
   Problem: snapshots accumulate, storage balloons, planning slows down
   Fix:     Schedule weekly: expire_snapshots + remove_orphan_files + rewrite_data_files

3. Using year() or month() partition transforms on high-query-frequency tables
   Problem: year(ts) creates partitions with millions of files — too coarse
   Fix:     Use days(ts) for daily-batch tables, hours(ts) for streaming tables

4. Over-partitioning with bucket()
   Problem: bucket(1000, user_id) creates 1000 files per write — too many small files
   Fix:     Start with bucket(16) or bucket(32); 128MB target file size

5. Creating tables as format V1
   Problem: V1 has no row-level deletes, so MERGE/UPDATE/DELETE must rewrite whole files
   Fix:     V2 is the default since Iceberg 1.4; set 'format-version' = '2' explicitly
            on older engines/versions (V3 adds deletion vectors — check engine support first)

6. Skipping OPTIMIZE after heavy upserts
   Problem: merge-on-read tables accumulate delete files → slower reads over time
   Fix:     Run rewrite_data_files after bulk upserts to compact
```

## Cheat Sheet

| Task | Spark SQL |
|------|-----------|
| Create table | `CREATE TABLE cat.db.t (...) USING iceberg PARTITIONED BY (days(ts))` |
| Append / overwrite partitions | `df.writeTo("cat.db.t").append()` · `.overwritePartitions()` |
| Upsert | `MERGE INTO cat.db.t t USING s ON t.id = s.id WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET * WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *` |
| Add / rename column | `ALTER TABLE t ADD COLUMN c INT` · `RENAME COLUMN a TO b` |
| Change partitioning (no rewrite) | `ALTER TABLE t ADD PARTITION FIELD hours(ts)` · `DROP PARTITION FIELD days(ts)` |
| Time travel | `SELECT ... FROM t VERSION AS OF <snapshot_id>` · `TIMESTAMP AS OF '2024-03-15 12:00:00'` |
| Roll back | `CALL cat.system.rollback_to_snapshot('db.t', <id>)` |
| List snapshots | `SELECT * FROM cat.db.t.snapshots` |
| Files and sizes | `SELECT file_path, record_count, file_size_in_bytes FROM cat.db.t.files` |
| Partition stats | `SELECT * FROM cat.db.t.partitions` |
| Compact | `CALL cat.system.rewrite_data_files(table => 'db.t')` |
| Expire snapshots | `CALL cat.system.expire_snapshots(table => 'db.t', older_than => TIMESTAMP '...', retain_last => 5)` |
| Remove orphan files | `CALL cat.system.remove_orphan_files(table => 'db.t')` |
| Merge-on-read for upsert-heavy tables | `ALTER TABLE t SET TBLPROPERTIES ('write.merge.mode'='merge-on-read', 'write.update.mode'='merge-on-read', 'write.delete.mode'='merge-on-read')` |
| Branch for write-audit-publish | `ALTER TABLE t CREATE BRANCH audit` → write with `spark.wap.branch` → `CALL cat.system.fast_forward('db.t', 'main', 'audit')` |

**Partition transforms:** `years` · `months` · `days` · `hours` · `bucket(N, col)` · `truncate(W, col)`

**Maintenance schedule (typical):** compact daily or after big loads · expire snapshots weekly (keep enough for your time-travel SLA) · remove orphan files weekly · rewrite manifests when query planning slows down

**Catalog options:** REST (Polaris, Unity Catalog, Nessie, Gravitino, and managed services) · AWS Glue · Hive Metastore · JDBC · Hadoop (local testing only)

## Interview Questions

**Q: What problem does Iceberg solve that raw Parquet files on S3 don't?**
A: Raw Parquet has no table concept — no ACID, no schema enforcement, no concurrent write safety, no history. Iceberg adds a metadata layer (snapshots, manifests) that makes S3 files into a real table with transactions, time travel, and schema evolution, while keeping the files open-format and readable by any engine.

**Q: What is hidden partitioning and why does it matter?**
A: In Hive/traditional partitioning, the query must include a filter on the partition column (`WHERE dt='2024-03-15'`) or it scans everything. In Iceberg, you define partition transforms (`days(event_ts)`) and Iceberg applies them transparently — the query just filters on `event_ts` and Iceberg handles pruning. This prevents accidental full-table scans.

**Q: How does Iceberg handle schema evolution without rewriting data?**
A: Iceberg tracks columns by a stable integer ID, not by name. When you rename a column, the ID stays the same — old files still map to the right column. New columns default to NULL for old files. Type changes are allowed only for safe widenings (int → long).

**Q: What is copy-on-write vs merge-on-read?**
A: Copy-on-write rewrites entire data files when rows are updated/deleted — reads are fast because there's only one file per row, but writes are expensive. Merge-on-read writes small delete/delta files alongside data files and merges them at read time — writes are fast, reads are slightly slower. Choose copy-on-write for read-heavy, update-infrequent tables; merge-on-read for frequent upserts.

**Q: What is an Iceberg catalog and why does it matter?**
A: The catalog maps a table name to the location of its *current* metadata file, and it's what makes commits atomic: a writer creates new metadata and then asks the catalog to swap the pointer from the old file to the new one, and that swap only succeeds if nobody else committed first (optimistic concurrency). Every engine that reads or writes the table must use the same catalog. The REST catalog spec has become the standard interface, so Spark, Trino, Flink, Snowflake, and others can all share one catalog.

**Q: How does Iceberg handle two jobs writing to the same table at the same time?**
A: Optimistic concurrency. Each writer reads the current snapshot, writes its data files, and then tries to commit new metadata based on that snapshot. If another commit landed first, the catalog rejects the swap; the writer then checks whether the two changes conflict (for example, both touched the same files or partitions). If they don't, it retries the commit on top of the new snapshot; if they do, the commit fails. Data files are never modified in place, so readers always see a consistent snapshot.

**Q: What maintenance does an Iceberg table need, and what happens if you skip it?**
A: Every write adds a snapshot plus metadata and manifest files, and streaming or small batches add many small data files. Without maintenance, storage keeps growing (old snapshots pin deleted files), query planning slows down (too many manifests), and scans slow down (small files, accumulated delete files). The fix is scheduled compaction (`rewrite_data_files`), snapshot expiration, orphan file removal, and occasional manifest rewrites. Some managed catalogs run these for you.

**Q: When would you choose Iceberg over Delta Lake?**
A: When several engines need to read and write the same tables (Spark, Trino, Flink, Snowflake, Athena, BigQuery), when you want to avoid tying storage to one vendor, or when partition evolution and hidden partitioning matter. Delta is the natural choice on Databricks, where features like Liquid Clustering and Predictive Optimization are tightly integrated. The gap is shrinking: Delta UniForm can expose Iceberg metadata, and Databricks and Snowflake both support Iceberg tables.
