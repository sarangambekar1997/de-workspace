## Overview

**Challenge:** Cloud data platforms bill for every query, every compute-second, every stored and transferred gigabyte. Costs grow quietly — an unfiltered dashboard refreshing every five minutes, a cluster that never shuts down, raw data kept forever — until a monthly bill triggers an emergency review. Without attribution, nobody knows which team, pipeline, or query is responsible.

**Solution:** FinOps applies engineering discipline to cloud spend in three repeating phases: **inform** (make costs visible and attributable), **optimize** (remove waste and right-size), and **operate** (budgets, guardrails, and cost-aware design as part of normal work). For data platforms, most savings come from reading less data, running compute only when needed, and matching freshness to real requirements.

```
          Inform                          Optimize                          Operate
  ─────────────────────────    ─────────────────────────────    ─────────────────────────────
  tag and attribute spend       read less data (pruning,          budgets and alerts
  cost per pipeline / team      columns, incremental)             quotas and guardrails
  unit costs (per query,        run compute only when needed      cost reviews in design and PRs
  per table, per customer)      right-size, tier storage          commitments for steady load
```

**Relevance to data engineering:** data engineers control the biggest cost levers — table layout, processing strategy, scheduling, and retention. Cost is a design requirement, like latency or correctness.

## Where the Money Goes

| Category | Examples | Typical drivers |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Warehouse / query compute | Credits, slots, RPUs, DBUs | Bytes scanned, runtime, idle time, concurrency |
| Cluster compute | Spark, Flink, orchestrator workers | Instance size and count, uptime, retries |
| Storage | Object storage, warehouse storage, time travel, backups | Retention, duplication, file inefficiency |
| Data transfer | Cross-region, cross-cloud, internet egress | Architecture and location choices |
| Managed services and SaaS | Ingestion connectors (per row), observability, BI licences | Volume, seats |
| AI workloads | LLM API tokens, embeddings, GPUs | Token volume, model choice, caching |

In most data platforms, **compute dominates**; storage is usually cheaper than expected and transfer is often a surprise.

---

## Unit Economics

Absolute spend is hard to judge; **unit costs** tie spend to value and reveal trends.

| Unit metric | Example | Useful for |
|-------------|---------|------------|
| Cost per pipeline run | $4.10 per daily `orders` run | Spotting regressions after code changes |
| Cost per table per month | $620/month to maintain `fct_sessions` | Deciding whether a table earns its cost |
| Cost per query / dashboard | $0.35 per dashboard load | Prioritizing pre-aggregation |
| Cost per customer or tenant | $0.12 per active customer per month | Pricing and margin analysis |
| Cost per TB processed | $3.20 per TB transformed | Comparing engines and approaches |

Track unit costs over time: if volume doubles and cost per unit stays flat, the platform scales well; if cost per unit rises, something is degrading.

---

## Visibility and Attribution

- **Tag everything:** cloud resources, clusters, warehouses, and jobs carry `team`, `pipeline`, `environment`, and `cost_center` tags (enforce with IaC policies)
- **Label queries:** set query tags or labels from pipelines so warehouse spend maps to jobs (e.g. Snowflake `QUERY_TAG`, BigQuery job labels, Databricks custom tags)
- **Separate compute per workload:** distinct warehouses/workgroups/clusters for ingestion, transformation, BI, and data science make attribution trivial
- **Centralize billing data:** export cloud billing (e.g. AWS CUR, GCP billing export, Azure cost exports) and platform usage tables into the warehouse, and build a cost dashboard like any other data product
- **Show back before you charge back:** share per-team costs first; charging budgets comes later

---

## Monitoring Spend by Platform

```sql
-- Snowflake: credits per warehouse, last 30 days
SELECT warehouse_name, SUM(credits_used) AS credits
FROM snowflake.account_usage.warehouse_metering_history
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY warehouse_name
ORDER BY credits DESC;

-- BigQuery: TiB billed per user, last 7 days
SELECT user_email, ROUND(SUM(total_bytes_billed) / POW(1024, 4), 2) AS tib_billed
FROM `region-us`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.JOBS_BY_PROJECT
WHERE creation_time >= TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)
GROUP BY user_email
ORDER BY tib_billed DESC;

-- Databricks: DBUs per SKU per day (system tables)
SELECT usage_date, sku_name, SUM(usage_quantity) AS dbus
FROM system.billing.usage
WHERE usage_date >= current_date() - INTERVAL 30 DAYS
GROUP BY usage_date, sku_name
ORDER BY usage_date, dbus DESC;

-- Redshift Serverless: compute usage per day
SELECT TRUNC(start_time) AS day, SUM(charged_seconds) / 3600.0 AS rpu_hours_charged
FROM sys_serverless_usage
WHERE start_time >= DATEADD(day, -30, GETDATE())
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

**What to look for:** the top 10 most expensive queries and jobs (usually most of the spend) · compute running with no queries · costs that jumped after a deployment · dashboards refreshing far more often than anyone views them

---

## Compute Optimization

| Lever | Practice |
|-------|----------|
| Run only when needed | Auto-suspend/auto-terminate (e.g. 60 s for warehouses, 10–30 min for interactive clusters); schedule dev environments off outside working hours |
| Right-size | Match size to workload; bigger compute that finishes faster can cost the same or less — measure |
| Scale elastically | Autoscaling clusters, multi-cluster warehouses for concurrency, serverless for spiky workloads |
| Use cheaper capacity | Spot/preemptible instances for fault-tolerant batch workers; ARM-based instances where supported |
| Isolate workloads | Separate compute so one team's heavy job doesn't force everything onto a larger size |
| Right engine for the size | Small and medium data on a single-node engine (DuckDB, Polars) instead of a cluster |
| Job compute, not interactive | Scheduled jobs on job clusters or serverless jobs instead of always-on interactive clusters |

---

## Query and Pipeline Optimization

- **Read less:** partition and cluster by common filters; select only needed columns; filter early
- **Process incrementally:** transform only new or changed partitions instead of rebuilding full tables
- **Materialize deliberately:** views for cheap, rarely used logic; tables or incremental models for expensive, frequently read logic; pre-aggregates for dashboards
- **Match refresh frequency to use:** a dashboard viewed once a morning doesn't need 5-minute refreshes
- **Avoid rework:** reuse intermediate results; cache results where the platform supports it
- **Fix the top offenders first:** the most expensive few queries typically account for a large share of spend

```sql
-- Before: full rebuild every hour, scanning two years of events
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE gold.daily_active_users AS
SELECT event_date, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS dau FROM silver.events GROUP BY event_date;

-- After: recompute only the last 3 days (covers late events) and merge
MERGE INTO gold.daily_active_users t
USING (
    SELECT event_date, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS dau
    FROM silver.events
    WHERE event_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 3
    GROUP BY event_date
) s
ON t.event_date = s.event_date
WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET dau = s.dau
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (event_date, dau) VALUES (s.event_date, s.dau);
```

---

## Storage Optimization

| Lever | Practice |
|-------|----------|
| Columnar formats and compression | Parquet/ORC with ZSTD or Snappy instead of CSV/JSON after the raw layer |
| Lifecycle tiers | Move raw data to infrequent-access and archive tiers after 30–90 days; expire temporary data |
| Retention by classification | Keep raw data only as long as reprocessing or compliance requires |
| Table-format housekeeping | Compact small files; expire snapshots; remove orphan files; limit time travel on large staging tables |
| Remove duplicates | Delete redundant copies and abandoned tables — use lineage and access logs to find tables no one reads |
| Transient/staging tables | No fail-safe or long time travel for data that can be rebuilt |

---

## Data Transfer Costs

- Keep compute in the **same region** as the data
- Avoid repeatedly reading data across clouds or regions — replicate once and read locally, or process where the data lives
- Use **private endpoints** (e.g. VPC gateway endpoints for object storage) to avoid NAT gateway processing charges
- Compress data before transferring it; send changes, not full copies
- Watch BI tools and notebooks that pull large result sets out of the cloud

---

## Commitments and Pricing Models

| Workload shape | Pricing approach |
|----------------|------------------|
| Steady, predictable baseline | Commitments: reserved capacity, savings plans, capacity/slot commitments, pre-purchased credits |
| Spiky or unpredictable | On-demand or serverless, billed only while running |
| Mixed | Commit to the steady baseline; burst on demand |

Commit only after usage has stabilized and been optimized — committing to waste locks it in.

---

## Guardrails and Budgets

- **Budgets and alerts** per team and environment, alerting on forecasted overspend, not only actual spend
- **Platform limits:** resource monitors and credit quotas (Snowflake), `maximum_bytes_billed` and custom quotas (BigQuery), usage limits and maximum capacity (Redshift Serverless), cluster policies with maximum size and auto-termination (Databricks)
- **Policies as code:** enforce tags, instance types, and auto-termination through IaC and cluster policies
- **Anomaly detection:** alert when daily spend deviates significantly from its trailing average
- **Cost in code review:** estimate the cost impact of new pipelines and schedules before they ship

---

## Cost-Aware Architecture

| Decision | Cheaper option | When the expensive option is justified |
|----------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Freshness | Daily or hourly batch | Decisions genuinely need minutes or seconds |
| Processing | Incremental | The logic can't be made incremental, or data is small |
| Engine | Single-node or warehouse SQL for small/medium data | Data volume or concurrency requires a cluster |
| Storage | Open formats on object storage with tiering | Low-latency serving requirements |
| Serving | Pre-aggregated tables | Truly ad hoc exploration over raw detail |
| Retention | Keep what reprocessing and compliance need | Contractual or regulatory retention |

State the cost of each major component in design documents, and revisit it after launch against actual spend.

---

## LLM and AI Workload Costs

- **Choose the smallest model that meets the quality bar** on your evaluation set
- **Cache** repeated prompt prefixes (prompt caching) and results for identical inputs
- **Batch APIs** for offline workloads — typically about half the price of synchronous calls
- **Trim tokens:** shorter prompts, fewer retrieved chunks, capped output length
- **Embed incrementally:** hash content and embed only new or changed text
- **Track cost per feature and per request** with token usage logged on every call

See [LLM APIs](../07-ai/llm-apis.md) and [AI Observability](../07-ai/ai-observability.md).

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| No tagging or labels | Cost reports say "compute" with no owner | Mandatory tags via IaC; query labels from pipelines |
| Always-on interactive compute | Spend continues nights and weekends | Auto-suspend and auto-termination everywhere |
| Full refreshes of large tables | Costs grow linearly with history | Incremental processing with a lookback window |
| Real-time pipelines for daily consumers | Always-on streaming bills | Match freshness to decisions; micro-batch or batch |
| Dashboards refreshing constantly | Warehouse busy all day | Refresh schedules aligned with usage; pre-aggregation; caching |
| Keeping everything forever | Storage and time-travel bills creep up | Retention by classification; lifecycle rules; snapshot expiration |
| Cross-region reads | Large, unexplained data-transfer charges | Co-locate compute and data |
| Committing before optimizing | Paying for capacity you don't need | Optimize first, then commit to the stable baseline |
| Optimizing tiny costs | Engineering time exceeds savings | Rank by spend; fix the top offenders first |

## Cheat Sheet

**The big five levers:** read less data · run compute only when needed · process incrementally · match freshness to decisions · tier and expire storage

**First-week audit checklist**
1. List the top 10 queries, jobs, and dashboards by cost
2. Find compute with no auto-suspend or auto-termination
3. Find tables rebuilt in full on every run
4. Find tables with no readers in 90 days
5. Check storage lifecycle rules and time-travel/snapshot retention
6. Check data-transfer charges by region pair
7. Confirm budgets and alerts exist per team and environment

**Platform guardrails:** Snowflake resource monitors · BigQuery `maximum_bytes_billed` and quotas · Redshift Serverless usage limits · Databricks cluster policies and budgets · cloud budgets with forecast alerts

## Interview Questions

**Q: A data platform's cloud bill doubled in a month. How do you investigate?**
A: Break the increase down by service, then by resource and tag, to find where it came from — compute, storage, or transfer. For warehouse compute, rank queries and jobs by cost in the platform's usage views and compare with the previous month. Typical causes are a new or changed pipeline doing full refreshes, a dashboard refreshing too often, compute left running, a backfill, or a new cross-region data flow. Fix the root cause, then add a guardrail (budget alert, quota, auto-suspend) so it can't recur silently.

**Q: How do you make data platform costs attributable to teams?**
A: Tag all cloud resources and jobs with team and pipeline, label warehouse queries from pipelines, and give each major workload its own compute (warehouse, workgroup, or cluster). Load billing exports and platform usage tables into the warehouse, join them on tags, and publish a cost dashboard by team and pipeline — starting with showback before any chargeback.

**Q: What are the most effective ways to reduce warehouse costs?**
A: Read less data (partitioning, clustering, column selection), process incrementally instead of full rebuilds, pre-aggregate for dashboards and align refresh schedules with actual usage, auto-suspend idle compute and right-size it, separate workloads, and set guardrails like quotas and resource monitors. Usually a small number of queries and pipelines account for most of the spend, so start there.

**Q: When is it worth paying for streaming or real-time processing?**
A: When the business decision it supports genuinely needs low latency and the value of acting faster exceeds the cost of always-on compute and operational complexity — fraud prevention, operational alerting, customer-facing features. For reports and analytics read periodically, hourly or daily batch delivers the same value at a fraction of the cost.
