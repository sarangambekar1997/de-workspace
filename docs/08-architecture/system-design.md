## Overview

**Challenge:** Individual tools are well documented; combining them into a system that meets real requirements is not. The same question — "build a pipeline for order analytics" — has very different answers depending on data volume, freshness needs, consumers, budget, and compliance constraints. Designs that ignore those constraints end up either over-engineered (a streaming platform for a daily report) or fragile (a nightly script expected to serve real-time decisions).

**Solution:** A repeatable design process: clarify requirements, estimate scale, choose an architecture pattern, select components for each layer, and then address reliability, data quality, security, and cost explicitly — documenting the trade-offs behind each decision.

```
Requirements ──→ Estimation ──→ Architecture pattern ──→ Components per layer ──→ Cross-cutting concerns
 who, what,       volume,        batch / streaming /       ingest · store ·          reliability · quality ·
 how fresh,       throughput,    lambda / kappa /          process · serve ·         security · cost ·
 SLAs, budget     storage        CDC / lakehouse           orchestrate               observability
```

**Relevance to data engineering:** system design is how senior data engineering work is evaluated — in design reviews and in interviews. The goal isn't a perfect architecture; it's a defensible one whose trade-offs are explicit.

## A Design Process

| Step | Output | Typical time in a 45-minute interview |
|------|--------|---------------------------------------|
| 1. Clarify requirements | Consumers, use cases, freshness, SLAs, constraints | 5–8 min |
| 2. Estimate scale | Events/day, peak throughput, storage growth | 3–5 min |
| 3. High-level architecture | Diagram: sources → ingestion → storage → processing → serving | 8–10 min |
| 4. Deep dive on critical parts | Data model, the hardest pipeline, failure handling | 10–15 min |
| 5. Cross-cutting concerns | Quality, reliability, security, cost, monitoring | 5 min |
| 6. Trade-offs and evolution | What you chose, what you gave up, what changes at 10× | 3–5 min |

State assumptions out loud, write them down, and revisit the design when an assumption changes.

---

## Clarifying Requirements

**Functional**
- Who consumes the data — dashboards, analysts, data scientists, ML models, applications, external partners?
- Which questions or products must it support? Which metrics, with what definitions?
- What are the sources — databases, event streams, APIs, files? Who owns them?
- Is history required (point-in-time analysis, audits), or only current state?

**Non-functional**

| Dimension | Questions | Why it matters |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Freshness | Seconds, minutes, hours, or daily? | Drives batch vs streaming — the biggest cost and complexity decision |
| Volume and growth | Events per day now and in 2 years? Peak vs average? | Sizing, partitioning, technology choice |
| Correctness | Exactly-once needed? Tolerance for late or duplicate data? | Idempotency, deduplication, reconciliation design |
| Availability / SLA | By when must data be ready? What if it's late? | Scheduling, alerting, redundancy |
| Query patterns | Aggregations over months? Point lookups by key? Ad hoc exploration? | Storage format, modeling, serving layer |
| Retention | How long to keep raw and modeled data? | Storage cost, lifecycle policies, compliance |
| Security / compliance | PII? Regulated data? Residency rules? | Access control, masking, region choices |
| Budget and team | Cost ceiling? Team skills? Build or buy? | Managed vs self-hosted, tool choice |

---

## Capacity Estimation

Rough numbers justify design choices. Round aggressively and show the arithmetic.

**Useful constants**

| Quantity | Approximation |
|----------|---------------|
| Seconds per day | ~86,400 ≈ 10⁵ |
| Peak-to-average ratio | 2–10× (use 3–5× if unknown) |
| JSON event | 0.5–2 KB |
| Parquet compression vs JSON | 5–10× smaller |
| One modern server/executor | Tens of MB/s of parsing and transformation per core |

**Worked example: 500 million events per day, ~1 KB each**

```
Average throughput   500M / 86,400 s        ≈ 6,000 events/s   ≈ 6 MB/s
Peak throughput      × 5                     ≈ 30,000 events/s ≈ 30 MB/s
Raw volume per day   500M × 1 KB            ≈ 500 GB/day (JSON)
As Parquet           ÷ ~7                    ≈ 70 GB/day
Per year (Parquet)   70 GB × 365             ≈ 25 TB/year
Kafka partitions     30 MB/s ÷ ~5 MB/s per partition (conservative) ≈ 6 → provision 12–24 for headroom
Daily partition size 70 GB ÷ ~512 MB target files ≈ 140 files/day
```

**Conclusions from the numbers:** one streaming cluster of modest size handles ingestion; storage growth is moderate and fits object storage cheaply; daily partitions with ~140 files each are healthy; aggregations over a year (25 TB) require a distributed engine or pre-aggregated tables for interactive dashboards.

## Building Blocks by Layer

| Layer | Purpose | Options (examples, not endorsements) |
|-------|---------|--------------------------------------|
| **Sources** | Where data originates | OLTP databases, SaaS APIs, event streams, files, logs |
| **Ingestion** | Move data into the platform | Batch extract, CDC (Debezium, cloud DMS), managed connectors, event streaming (Kafka, Kinesis, Pub/Sub) |
| **Storage** | Durable, queryable data | Object storage + open table formats (Iceberg, Delta, Hudi); cloud warehouses (BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Synapse) |
| **Processing** | Transform and model | SQL in the warehouse, Spark, Flink, streaming SQL, Python for small data (DuckDB, Polars) |
| **Orchestration** | Schedule and coordinate | Airflow, Dagster, Prefect, cloud-native schedulers, event-driven triggers |
| **Serving** | Deliver data to consumers | Warehouse/BI, semantic layer, OLAP stores (ClickHouse, Druid, Pinot), key-value stores, APIs, reverse ETL, feature stores |
| **Quality** | Detect bad data | Tests in the transformation layer, validation frameworks, anomaly detection, data contracts |
| **Governance** | Know and control data | Catalog, lineage, access policies, classification, retention |
| **Observability** | Know the system is healthy | Freshness, volume, and schema monitors; pipeline metrics; cost dashboards |

Choose per layer based on requirements — and prefer fewer, well-understood components over many specialized ones.

## Architecture Patterns

### Batch lakehouse / warehouse (medallion)

```
sources ──batch/CDC──→ bronze (raw, immutable) ──→ silver (clean, conformed) ──→ gold (modeled, aggregated) ──→ BI / ML
                                        orchestrator runs each layer on a schedule, with tests between layers
```
**Use for:** most analytics; freshness of an hour to a day. **Strengths:** simple, cheap, easy to backfill. **Weakness:** latency.

### Streaming (Kappa)

```
producers ──→ event log (Kafka) ──→ stream processor ──→ serving store / lakehouse tables
                    └── replay the log to reprocess history
```
**Use for:** second-level freshness, operational use cases (fraud, alerting, live dashboards). **Strengths:** one code path for real-time and reprocessing. **Weakness:** operational complexity; long retention needed to replay.

### Lambda (batch + speed layer)

```
events ──┬──→ batch layer (complete, accurate, slow) ──┐
         └──→ speed layer (approximate, fast)       ──┴──→ serving merges both
```
**Use for:** legacy designs or when batch correctness and real-time views are both required. **Weakness:** two code paths that must agree — usually replaced today by streaming into table formats plus batch compaction.

### CDC-based replication

```
OLTP database ──log-based CDC──→ change stream ──→ bronze change log ──MERGE──→ silver mirror tables ──→ models
```
**Use for:** analytics on operational data with minutes of latency and full delete/update fidelity.

### Reverse ETL and operational analytics

```
warehouse models (customer scores, segments) ──→ sync ──→ CRM, marketing, support tools
```
**Use for:** putting modeled data back into business applications.

### Data mesh (organizational pattern)

Domain teams own and publish their data as products (with contracts, SLAs, and documentation) on a shared self-service platform. **Use for:** large organizations where a central team is the bottleneck. It changes ownership, not just technology.

## Batch or Streaming?

| Question | Suggests batch | Suggests streaming |
|----------|----------------|--------------------|
| Required freshness | Hours or daily | Seconds to a few minutes |
| Consumer | Humans reading dashboards and reports | Machines acting on events (fraud checks, alerts, personalization) |
| Data arrival | Files, periodic exports | Continuous events |
| Transformations | Complex joins across many large tables | Per-event logic, windowed aggregations |
| Team experience | SQL, orchestration | Stream processing, stateful systems operations |
| Cost sensitivity | High | Business value justifies always-on compute |

**Middle ground:** micro-batches every 5–15 minutes (incremental processing on a schedule, or streaming engines with `availableNow`-style triggers) satisfy most "near real time" requirements at a fraction of the complexity.

---

## Storage and Serving Choices

| Access pattern | Good fit |
|----------------|----------|
| Large scans and aggregations, ad hoc SQL | Warehouse, or lakehouse tables with a SQL engine |
| Many engines sharing the same data | Open table format (Iceberg/Delta) in object storage |
| Sub-second dashboards over billions of events | OLAP store (ClickHouse, Druid, Pinot) or pre-aggregated tables |
| Point lookups by key at high QPS | Key-value / document store (e.g. DynamoDB, Bigtable, Cassandra, Redis) |
| Features for ML training and online inference | Feature store (offline tables + online key-value store) |
| Full-text or semantic search | Search engine or vector index |
| Sharing data with external parties | Data sharing features, exports to object storage, or APIs |

**Modeling for serving:** star schemas for BI; wide denormalized tables for specific dashboards; pre-aggregated rollups for high-concurrency, low-latency use cases.

---

## Reliability and Correctness

| Concern | Design choice |
|---------|---------------|
| Retries and reruns | Every task idempotent: overwrite partitions or `MERGE` on keys; no blind appends |
| Duplicates | Stable event IDs; deduplicate in silver; exactly-once only where the sink supports it |
| Late data | Event-time processing with watermarks; reprocess affected partitions for a lookback window |
| Backfills | Parameterize by date range; same code path as daily runs; throttle to protect sources |
| Source outages | Retries with backoff; alert on freshness; don't publish partial data as complete |
| Bad data | Validate at each layer; quarantine; block publication of gold tables when critical tests fail |
| Schema changes | Contracts, schema registry, automatic handling of additive changes, alerts on breaking ones |
| Recovery | Immutable raw layer + time travel in table formats; documented runbooks |

**Publish atomically:** consumers should see either yesterday's complete data or today's complete data — never a half-written table. Table formats (single commit), write-then-swap, or views pointing to the latest complete partition achieve this.

---

## Scalability

- **Partition** large tables by the most common filter (usually a date); cluster or sort on secondary filters
- **Avoid skew:** hot keys in joins and aggregations (salting, broadcast joins, adaptive execution)
- **Keep files healthy:** 128 MB–1 GB files; compact small files from streaming writes
- **Process incrementally:** transform only new or changed partitions instead of full refreshes
- **Scale ingestion horizontally:** partitions in the event log, parallel extract tasks, consumer groups
- **Separate workloads:** isolated compute for ingestion, transformation, BI, and data science so they don't compete
- **Know the next bottleneck:** state what breaks at 10× — and how the design would change

---

## Security, Privacy, and Compliance

| Area | Practice |
|------|----------|
| Access | Role-based access, least privilege, separate service identities per pipeline, no shared personal credentials |
| Sensitive data | Classify columns; mask, tokenize, or hash PII; restrict raw layers containing PII |
| Encryption | At rest (managed keys, or customer-managed for regulated data) and in transit (TLS) |
| Secrets | Secrets manager; short-lived credentials via workload identity |
| Right to erasure (e.g. GDPR) | Know where each person's data lives (lineage + catalog); delete with `MERGE`/`DELETE` in table formats, then expire old snapshots so deleted data is physically removed |
| Residency | Keep regulated data in its required region; replicate only derived or anonymized data |
| Audit | Log data access and changes; retain audit logs per policy |

---

## Cost

| Lever | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Right freshness | Hourly instead of real-time can cut compute cost by an order of magnitude |
| Incremental processing | Process only what changed |
| Storage tiers and lifecycle rules | Move old raw data to archive tiers; expire temporary data |
| Columnar formats and compression | Less storage and less data scanned per query |
| Partition pruning and clustering | Queries read only relevant data |
| Auto-suspend and autoscaling | Pay for compute only while it's working |
| Workload isolation and tagging | Attribute cost per team and pipeline; find the expensive jobs |
| Pre-aggregation for dashboards | Avoid re-scanning raw data for every dashboard view |

State expected costs in the design, even roughly — it is part of the trade-off.

## Worked Design: Clickstream Analytics

**Requirements:** 500M events/day from web and mobile apps; product dashboards within 5 minutes; analysts need 2 years of history; sessionization; PII (IP address, user ID) must be protected.

```
apps ──HTTPS──→ collector service ──→ event log (24 partitions, 7-day retention)
                                           │
                     stream processor: validate, enrich (geo from IP, then drop IP),
                     deduplicate by event_id, event-time windows with 10-min watermark
                        │                                   │
         bronze_events (Iceberg/Delta, append,       rollups_5m (pre-aggregated by page,
         partitioned by event_date)                   country, device) → real-time dashboard
                        │
         nightly batch: sessionize (30-min inactivity), build fct_sessions, fct_page_views,
         dim_user (pseudonymous ID) → warehouse/BI for analysts
```

**Key decisions and trade-offs**
- Streaming for the 5-minute dashboards; batch for sessionization and history (cheaper, simpler, easy to backfill)
- Raw IP used only for enrichment, then dropped; user IDs pseudonymized in silver
- Dashboard reads small pre-aggregated tables, not raw events
- Late events (mobile apps offline) handled by the watermark for real-time views and by the nightly batch for complete history
- At 10×: more partitions and processor instances; compaction jobs for streaming output; OLAP store for dashboards if concurrency grows

## Worked Design: Operational Database to Lakehouse

**Requirements:** replicate 40 tables from a production Postgres database for analytics; latency under 15 minutes; deletes must be reflected; no noticeable load on production; point-in-time history for customers.

```
Postgres (logical replication) ──→ CDC connector ──→ change topics (one per table, Avro + schema registry)
                                                          │
                              bronze_<table>_changes: append-only change log (op, before, after, LSN)
                                                          │  every 10 minutes
                              silver_<table>: MERGE latest change per key by LSN (deletes applied)
                                                          │
                              dim_customer (SCD Type 2 built from the change log) · fact tables · marts
```

**Key decisions and trade-offs**
- Log-based CDC: captures deletes, preserves order, minimal source load
- Change log kept append-only: supports audits, SCD Type 2, and rebuilding silver from scratch
- 10-minute micro-batch `MERGE` instead of per-event updates: meets the SLA with far less cost than continuous upserts
- Monitoring: replication slot lag, connector status, end-to-end freshness per table, daily row-count reconciliation with the source
- Schema changes: additive columns evolve automatically; breaking changes pause the affected table and alert

---

## Worked Design: Daily Business Metrics with an SLA

**Requirements:** finance and leadership dashboards with revenue, orders, and customer metrics; data complete by 07:00 local time; numbers must match the billing system to the cent; 12 sources including SaaS APIs and two databases.

```
02:00  ingestion tasks (managed connectors + custom API extracts) → bronze
03:00  sensors confirm every source delivered yesterday's data (freshness + row-count checks)
03:15  transformations: staging → intermediate → marts, run incrementally, tests after each layer
05:30  reconciliation: revenue vs billing system totals (tolerance: 0.01)
05:45  publish: swap views to the new partition only if every critical test passes
06:00  buffer for retries  ·  07:00 SLA  ·  alerts to on-call from 06:15 if not published
```

**Key decisions and trade-offs**
- Batch is sufficient: daily consumers; simplicity and cost win
- Explicit dependency on source freshness — never publish metrics built on missing data
- Reconciliation against the system of record is a blocking test, because trust is the product
- Atomic publish: dashboards show yesterday's complete numbers until today's pass every check
- Metric definitions in one place (a semantic layer or governed gold tables) so every dashboard agrees

---

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Designing before clarifying requirements | Wrong freshness, wrong grain, rework | Spend the first minutes on consumers, SLAs, volume, and constraints |
| Streaming by default | High cost and on-call burden for data read once a day | Match freshness to the actual decision latency; consider micro-batch |
| No estimates | Components wildly over- or under-sized | Back-of-the-envelope numbers for throughput, storage, and files |
| Too many tools | Integration and operational overhead dominates | Fewer components; use managed services where they fit |
| Non-idempotent pipelines | Duplicates and gaps after every retry or backfill | Overwrite partitions or `MERGE`; parameterize by date |
| Publishing partial data | Dashboards show a revenue drop that isn't real | Freshness gates, blocking tests, atomic publish |
| Ignoring deletes and late data | Silent divergence from the source | CDC or reconciliation; watermarks and lookback reprocessing |
| Security added at the end | PII spread across every layer | Classify and protect at ingestion; least-privilege access by layer |
| No cost model | Surprise bills after launch | Estimate cost per component; tag and monitor spend |
| No evolution story | Redesign needed at the first growth spurt | State what changes at 10× and where the next bottleneck is |

## Cheat Sheet

**Interview framework:** clarify → estimate → high-level diagram → deep dive → reliability, quality, security, cost → trade-offs and 10× plan

**Freshness → architecture**

| Freshness | Typical design |
|-----------|----------------|
| Daily | Scheduled batch, medallion layers, orchestrator |
| Hourly | Incremental batch (only new partitions) |
| 5–15 minutes | Micro-batch or CDC + periodic `MERGE` |
| Seconds | Event log + stream processor + low-latency serving store |

**Estimation shortcuts:** 1 day ≈ 10⁵ s · peak ≈ 3–5× average · JSON → Parquet ≈ 5–10× smaller · target files 128 MB–1 GB · 1M events/day ≈ 12 events/s

**Checklist for every design:** idempotency · late data · backfills · schema changes · data quality gates · atomic publish · monitoring (freshness, volume, errors, cost) · access control and PII · retention · disaster recovery · ownership and on-call

## Interview Questions

**Q: How do you approach a data system design question?**
A: Clarify requirements first — consumers, use cases, freshness, volume, correctness, SLAs, security, and budget — and write assumptions down. Estimate scale with rough numbers. Draw the high-level flow from sources through ingestion, storage, processing, and serving. Deep-dive into the hardest part (often the data model or correctness under failure). Then cover reliability, quality, security, and cost, and finish with trade-offs and what changes at 10× scale.

**Q: When is streaming worth it compared with batch?**
A: When a consumer acts on data within seconds or minutes — fraud detection, alerting, operational dashboards, personalization — and the value of that speed exceeds the added cost and complexity of always-on stateful processing. For humans reading reports, hourly or daily batch is usually enough, and micro-batching every few minutes covers most "near real time" needs at a fraction of the effort.

**Q: How do you make sure dashboards never show incomplete data?**
A: Gate publication on completeness: check that every source delivered (freshness and row-count checks), run blocking data tests and reconciliations, and publish atomically — a single table-format commit, or a view swap to the new partition — only after everything passes. Until then, consumers keep seeing the previous complete version, and on-call is alerted if the SLA is at risk.

**Q: Compare Lambda and Kappa architectures.**
A: Lambda runs a batch layer for complete, accurate results and a speed layer for low-latency approximations, merging them at query time — but it requires maintaining two implementations of the same logic. Kappa uses a single streaming path and reprocesses history by replaying the event log, which is simpler but needs long retention and a capable stream processor. Many modern designs stream into open table formats and use batch jobs only for compaction and corrections, getting most of the benefit of both.

**Q: How would you design for a GDPR deletion request in a data lake?**
A: Know where the person's data lives through a catalog and lineage keyed by a stable identifier. Minimize the problem by pseudonymizing identifiers early and keeping direct PII in few, well-known tables. Execute deletes with `DELETE`/`MERGE` in the table format across affected tables, then expire old snapshots and vacuum files so the data is physically removed, and record the request's completion for audit. Raw immutable layers need either short retention or encryption per subject (crypto-shredding).

**Q: What would change in your design at 10× the volume?**
A: Name the first bottleneck and its fix: more partitions and consumers for ingestion; incremental rather than full processing; stronger partitioning, clustering, and compaction; pre-aggregation for serving; separate compute per workload; and revisiting cost — for example tiered storage or shorter raw retention. The goal is to show you know where the design stops working, not to over-build for it on day one.
