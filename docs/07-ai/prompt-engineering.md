## What Is a Prompt

A prompt is the input you send to an LLM. The quality of the prompt directly determines the quality of the output. Unlike traditional software, there's no compiler error for a bad prompt — it just produces worse results silently.

```
Input:  "Summarize this."
Output: A vague summary

Input:  "Summarize this SQL query in one sentence, focusing on what business question it answers."
Output: A precise, useful summary
```

The key insight: **LLMs are next-token predictors**. A well-crafted prompt sets up a context where the most likely next tokens are exactly what you want.

---

## Message Roles

Modern LLM APIs use a conversation format with three roles:

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `system` | Instructions that frame the entire conversation — persona, rules, output format |
| `user` | The human's message — the task, question, or input |
| `assistant` | The model's response (can be pre-filled to steer output) |

```python
# Anthropic Claude
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the capital of France?"}
]

# With system prompt
# (system is passed as a separate parameter in Anthropic's API)
```

```python
# OpenAI
messages = [
    {"role": "system",    "content": "You are a helpful data engineer."},
    {"role": "user",      "content": "What is the capital of France?"},
]
```

---

## Zero-Shot Prompting

Ask directly with no examples. Works well for simple, well-defined tasks.

```python
# Too vague
prompt = "Analyze this data."

# Better — specific task, specific output
prompt = """
Analyze the following CSV column for data quality issues.
Report: null count, unique count, min, max, and any anomalies.

Column (order_amount):
[12.5, 99.0, -5.0, 0.0, null, 150.0, 12.5, 99999.0]
"""
```

**Rules for good zero-shot prompts:**
1. State the task explicitly
2. Specify the desired output format
3. Provide any relevant context or constraints
4. Use imperative mood ("List", "Explain", "Write", not "Can you list...")

---

## Few-Shot Prompting

Provide examples of input/output pairs before the actual task. Dramatically improves consistency for classification, formatting, and pattern-following tasks.

```python
prompt = """
Classify the following SQL query type. Reply with one word: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or DDL.

Query: SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'shipped'
Type: SELECT

Query: INSERT INTO logs (event, ts) VALUES ('login', NOW())
Type: INSERT

Query: CREATE TABLE dim_customer (id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR)
Type: DDL

Query: UPDATE orders SET status = 'cancelled' WHERE order_id = 42
Type:"""
# Model completes: UPDATE
```

```python
# Few-shot for consistent formatting
prompt = """
Convert natural language to a dbt model name.

Input: "Daily revenue by region"
Output: fct_revenue_daily_by_region

Input: "Customer lifetime value"
Output: fct_customer_lifetime_value

Input: "Raw orders from Stripe"
Output: stg_stripe__orders

Input: "Weekly active users"
Output:"""
```

**Tips:**
- Use 3–5 examples — more doesn't always help
- Make examples representative of the full range of inputs
- Keep the same format exactly — spacing and punctuation matter
- Put the actual task last

---

## System Prompts

The system prompt defines the model's behavior for the entire conversation. Think of it as the constructor for the LLM session.

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

system = """
You are an expert data engineer reviewing dbt models.

When reviewing SQL:
- Point out performance issues (missing indexes, full table scans, cartesian joins)
- Flag correctness issues (wrong join type, NULL handling, off-by-one in date ranges)
- Suggest dbt best practices (ref() usage, naming conventions, incremental strategies)

Format your response as:
1. Summary (1 sentence)
2. Issues (bulleted list, severity: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
3. Suggested fix (code block)

If there are no issues, say "LGTM" and briefly explain why.
"""

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    system=system,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Review this model:\n\nSELECT * FROM orders o, customers c WHERE o.customer_id = c.id"}
    ]
)
print(next(b.text for b in response.content if b.type == "text"))
```

**Good system prompt structure:**
```
1. Role/persona:   "You are an expert X"
2. Context:        "You are helping Y team do Z"
3. Rules:          "Always / Never / When X do Y"
4. Output format:  "Respond as JSON / in this template / with these sections"
5. Constraints:    "Be concise / Use only information provided / Do not hallucinate"
```

---

## Chain-of-Thought

Force the model to reason step by step before answering. Dramatically improves accuracy on multi-step problems.

```python
# Without CoT — often wrong on logic problems
prompt = "A pipeline runs at 2am and takes 3 hours. It's 4am. Is it done? Answer yes or no."

# With CoT — correct
prompt = """
A pipeline runs at 2am and takes 3 hours. It's 4am. Is it done?
Think through it step by step before answering.
"""
# Output: "The pipeline started at 2am. It takes 3 hours, so it finishes at 5am. It is currently 4am. Therefore: No, it is not done yet."
```

```python
# Zero-shot CoT — just add "Think step by step"
prompt = f"""
{question}

Think through this step by step.
"""

# Few-shot CoT — show reasoning in examples
prompt = """
Q: If a Kafka topic has 6 partitions and 2 consumers in a group, how many partitions does each consumer handle?
A: Each consumer in a consumer group gets an exclusive assignment of partitions.
   With 6 partitions and 2 consumers: 6 / 2 = 3 partitions per consumer.
   Answer: 3

Q: If a Kafka topic has 3 partitions and 5 consumers in a group, how many partitions does each consumer handle?
A:"""
# Output: "With fewer partitions than consumers, some consumers will be idle.
#          3 partitions / 5 consumers = 3 consumers get 1 partition each, 2 consumers get 0.
#          Answer: at most 1 partition per active consumer; 2 consumers are idle."
```

---

## Structured Output

Get JSON or other structured formats reliably.

```python
import anthropic
import json

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

prompt = """
Extract structured information from this pipeline error log.

Log:
2024-03-15 03:42:11 ERROR airflow.task [dag_id=daily_orders, task_id=load_snowflake, run_id=scheduled__2024-03-15T02:00:00] 
OperationalError: connection to Snowflake timed out after 30s. Retry 3/3.

Return ONLY valid JSON with these fields:
{
  "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
  "severity": "ERROR|WARN|INFO",
  "pipeline": "dag name",
  "task": "task name",
  "error_type": "short error class",
  "message": "human readable summary",
  "is_retryable": true/false
}
"""

response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-5",
    max_tokens=512,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
)

result = json.loads(next(b.text for b in response.content if b.type == "text"))
print(result)
# {
#   "timestamp": "2024-03-15T03:42:11",
#   "severity": "ERROR",
#   "pipeline": "daily_orders",
#   "task": "load_snowflake",
#   "error_type": "OperationalError",
#   "message": "Snowflake connection timed out after 30s, exhausted 3 retries",
#   "is_retryable": true
# }
```

**Tips for reliable JSON:**
- Say "Return ONLY valid JSON" — no prose before or after
- Provide the exact schema with field names and types
- Use structured outputs to *guarantee* schema-valid JSON (Anthropic: `output_config.format` / `client.messages.parse`; OpenAI: `response_format` with a JSON schema)
- Assistant prefill (starting the reply with `{`) is no longer supported on current Claude models — it returns a 400

```python
# Structured outputs (Anthropic) — the response is validated against the schema
from pydantic import BaseModel

class PipelineError(BaseModel):
    pipeline_name: str
    error_type: str

response = client.messages.parse(
    model="claude-sonnet-5",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Extract the pipeline name and error type:\n{log_line}"}],
    output_format=PipelineError,
)
error = response.parsed_output      # a validated PipelineError instance
print(error.pipeline_name, error.error_type)
```

## Common Failure Modes

| Failure | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| **Hallucination** | Model invents facts | "Use only information provided. If unknown, say so." |
| **Ignored instructions** | Too many rules | Prioritize — put most important instruction last |
| **Inconsistent format** | No examples | Add few-shot examples of the exact format |
| **Too verbose** | No length constraint | "Respond in 2 sentences max" / "Be concise" |
| **Sycophancy** | Model agrees with wrong premise | "Do not agree with incorrect statements. Point out errors directly." |
| **Wrong language** | Mixed-language inputs | "Always respond in English regardless of the input language" |
| **Partial JSON** | Long output truncated | Increase `max_tokens` or ask for shorter output |

---

## Prompt Chaining

Break complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts. Each step's output becomes the next step's input.

```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()

def call(system: str, user: str) -> str:
    r = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-5",
        max_tokens=1024,
        system=system,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": user}]
    )
    return next(b.text for b in r.content if b.type == "text")

# Step 1: Extract intent
intent = call(
    system="Extract the user's data engineering intent as a single sentence.",
    user="I need something that loads new orders from S3 every hour and puts them in Snowflake"
)
# → "Load new orders from S3 to Snowflake on an hourly schedule"

# Step 2: Generate component list
components = call(
    system="List the data pipeline components needed. Output as a JSON array of strings.",
    user=f"Intent: {intent}"
)
# → ["S3 source bucket", "Snowflake destination table", "Airflow DAG", "schedule: @hourly", "incremental load logic"]

# Step 3: Generate code
code = call(
    system="Write a production-ready Airflow DAG. Use the S3ToSnowflakeOperator.",
    user=f"Build a pipeline for: {intent}\nComponents: {components}"
)
```

**When to chain:**
- Task requires different expertise at different stages (extract → reason → format)
- Output of one step needs validation before the next
- You want to audit intermediate steps
- Single prompt is getting too long and complex

## Role & Persona Prompting

```python
# Technical expert persona
system = """
You are a senior data engineer with 10 years of experience in distributed systems.
You give direct, technically precise answers. You don't hedge or add unnecessary caveats.
When you see a bad pattern, you say so and explain why.
"""

# Adversarial reviewer
system = """
You are a skeptical code reviewer. Your job is to find every possible problem with
the code you're shown. Assume the code will be run in production at 100x scale.
Find performance issues, edge cases, and correctness bugs. Be harsh but specific.
"""

# Structured analyst
system = """
You are a data analyst. When given data or a query, you always:
1. State what you observe (facts only)
2. State what it implies (inferences, clearly labeled)
3. State what you'd investigate next (questions)
Never mix observations with inferences.
"""
```

---

## Meta-Prompting

Use an LLM to write or improve prompts.

```python
meta_prompt = """
I have the following prompt that isn't working well:

--- CURRENT PROMPT ---
{current_prompt}
--- END PROMPT ---

The problem is: {problem_description}

Rewrite the prompt to fix this issue. Explain what you changed and why.
"""

# Self-improvement loop
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-5",
    max_tokens=2048,
    messages=[{
        "role": "user",
        "content": meta_prompt.format(
            current_prompt="Summarize this data pipeline.",
            problem_description="It gives too much detail and doesn't focus on business impact."
        )
    }]
)
```

---

## Prompt Versioning & Testing

Treat prompts like code: version them, test them, measure regressions.

```python
# prompts/pipeline_summary/v2.txt
PROMPT_REGISTRY = {
    "pipeline_summary": {
        "v1": "Summarize this pipeline.",
        "v2": "Summarize this pipeline in 2 sentences: what it does and what business question it answers.",
        "v3": "In one sentence each: (1) What this pipeline computes. (2) Who depends on it.",
    }
}

# Eval harness
TEST_CASES = [
    {
        "input": "SELECT SUM(amount) FROM orders GROUP BY DATE(created_at)",
        "expected_keywords": ["daily", "revenue", "orders"],
    },
    {
        "input": "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE last_seen < NOW() - INTERVAL 90 DAY",
        "expected_keywords": ["inactive", "churned", "customers"],
    },
]

def eval_prompt(prompt_version: str, test_cases: list) -> float:
    prompt_template = PROMPT_REGISTRY["pipeline_summary"][prompt_version]
    passed = 0
    for case in test_cases:
        output = call("", prompt_template + "\n\n" + case["input"]).lower()
        if all(kw in output for kw in case["expected_keywords"]):
            passed += 1
    return passed / len(test_cases)

for version in ["v1", "v2", "v3"]:
    score = eval_prompt(version, TEST_CASES)
    print(f"{version}: {score:.0%}")
```

**Prompt engineering best practices:**
- Keep prompts in files, not hardcoded strings
- Version them (`v1`, `v2`) and never delete old versions
- Write test cases before changing prompts
- Log all prompts and responses in production (for debugging and fine-tuning)
- Keep system prompts and user templates separate
- Test on adversarial inputs (empty input, very long input, wrong language)
