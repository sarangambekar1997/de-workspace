## Plain English

**What is fine-tuning?**

A pre-trained LLM (like Claude or GPT-4) learned from the entire internet. It knows a lot, but it doesn't know *your* company's tone, *your* specific domain jargon, or *your* exact output format.

Fine-tuning is like giving the model extra training on examples specific to your use case. You show it hundreds or thousands of (input, ideal output) pairs, and the model adjusts its weights to produce outputs closer to those examples.

```
Pre-trained model:       Knows everything generally
Fine-tuned model:        Knows your specific thing very well

Examples of what fine-tuning fixes:
  "Always respond in SQL, never prose"
  "Use our internal table naming convention"
  "Output JSON that matches our exact schema"
  "Write in our company's brand voice"
  "Classify support tickets into our 40 internal categories"
```

**Fine-tuning vs RAG — when to use which:**

```
Use RAG when:
  ✓ Your knowledge base changes frequently
  ✓ You need source citations
  ✓ You want to add new facts the model doesn't know

Use fine-tuning when:
  ✓ You need a consistent output format the model ignores in prompts
  ✓ You need a specific tone or style the model doesn't adopt
  ✓ You're classifying into custom categories not in the base model
  ✓ You need faster inference (smaller fine-tuned model > larger base model)
  ✓ RAG works but the model still doesn't follow instructions reliably

Use both when:
  ✓ Fine-tune for behavior/format, RAG for knowledge
```

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Plain English |
|---------|--------------|
| **Full fine-tuning** | Update all model weights — most powerful, most expensive, requires A100/H100 GPUs |
| **LoRA** | Update only a tiny fraction of weights via low-rank matrices — 10-100x cheaper, nearly as good |
| **PEFT** | Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning — umbrella term for LoRA and similar techniques |
| **Training data** | (prompt, completion) pairs showing the model what good output looks like |
| **Epochs** | How many times the model trains over your entire dataset |
| **Overfitting** | Model memorizes training examples instead of learning the pattern — use a validation set |
| **Base model** | The starting point — a pre-trained model you fine-tune from |
| **Adapter** | A small trained add-on (LoRA) attached to the base model — easy to swap |

## When Fine-Tuning Helps (and When It Doesn't)

```python
# Signs fine-tuning is the right call:
GOOD_CANDIDATES = [
    "Output format: model ignores JSON schema even with detailed prompts",
    "Style: model writes formally but you need casual/brand voice",
    "Classification: 40+ custom categories not in base model's vocabulary",
    "Extraction: model misses domain-specific entities (internal product names)",
    "Latency: need a smaller, faster model for high-volume inference",
    "Cost: serving a fine-tuned 7B model << serving GPT-4 at volume",
]

# Signs fine-tuning won't help:
BAD_CANDIDATES = [
    "Knowledge: model doesn't know facts that change weekly → use RAG",
    "Hallucination: model makes things up → fine-tuning won't fix grounding",
    "Small dataset: < 50 examples → few-shot prompting is enough",
    "One-off task: task runs once per day → prompting is cheaper",
    "No eval: you can't measure if fine-tuning improved things",
]
```

## Preparing Training Data

Training data quality matters far more than quantity. 50 excellent examples beat 5000 mediocre ones.

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path

# OpenAI fine-tuning format: JSONL, one example per line
# Each example is a full conversation

def create_training_example(user_msg: str, assistant_msg: str,
                             system: str = None) -> dict:
    messages = []
    if system:
        messages.append({"role": "system", "content": system})
    messages.append({"role": "user",      "content": user_msg})
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_msg})
    return {"messages": messages}

# Example: fine-tune for SQL generation
examples = [
    create_training_example(
        system="You are a SQL expert. Generate Snowflake SQL only. No explanations.",
        user_msg="Count orders by status for the last 30 days",
        assistant_msg="""SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
WHERE created_at >= DATEADD(day, -30, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY order_count DESC;"""
    ),
    create_training_example(
        system="You are a SQL expert. Generate Snowflake SQL only. No explanations.",
        user_msg="Show me the top 10 customers by revenue this year",
        assistant_msg="""SELECT c.customer_id, c.name, SUM(o.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id
WHERE YEAR(o.created_at) = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE())
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 10;"""
    ),
    # ... add 50-200 more examples
]

# Write training file
with open("training_data.jsonl", "w") as f:
    for ex in examples:
        f.write(json.dumps(ex) + "\n")

# Write validation file (10-20% of training set)
split = int(len(examples) * 0.8)
with open("validation_data.jsonl", "w") as f:
    for ex in examples[split:]:
        f.write(json.dumps(ex) + "\n")
```

### Data quality checklist

```python
def validate_training_data(filepath: str) -> dict:
    """Check training data for common problems."""
    issues = []
    examples = []
    total_tokens = 0

    with open(filepath) as f:
        for i, line in enumerate(f):
            try:
                ex = json.loads(line)
                examples.append(ex)
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                issues.append(f"Line {i}: invalid JSON")
                continue

            msgs = ex.get("messages", [])

            # Must have user + assistant turn
            roles = [m["role"] for m in msgs]
            if "user" not in roles:
                issues.append(f"Line {i}: missing user message")
            if "assistant" not in roles:
                issues.append(f"Line {i}: missing assistant message")

            # Estimate token count
            text_length = sum(len(m["content"]) for m in msgs)
            total_tokens += text_length // 4  # rough estimate

    avg_tokens = total_tokens // max(len(examples), 1)

    return {
        "total_examples": len(examples),
        "issues":         issues,
        "avg_tokens":     avg_tokens,
        "ready":          len(issues) == 0 and len(examples) >= 10
    }

result = validate_training_data("training_data.jsonl")
print(result)
```

## LoRA / PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)

**Why LoRA?** Full fine-tuning a 7B parameter model requires ~56GB GPU memory and takes days. LoRA adds tiny trainable matrices to the existing weights, updating only ~0.1% of parameters — same quality, 10-100x cheaper.

```
Full fine-tuning:
  Original weights W (7B params) → updated W' (7B params)
  GPU memory: ~56GB for fp32
  Training time: days

LoRA:
  Original weights W (frozen)
  Two small matrices A (r×d) and B (d×r) where r << d
  Update = W + A×B  (only A and B are trained)
  r=16 adds ~0.1% trainable parameters
  GPU memory: ~8GB with 4-bit quantization
  Training time: hours
```

```python
# LoRA hyperparameter guide
lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=8,        # rank: 4-64; higher = more capacity, more memory
                # start with 8-16; increase if underfitting

    lora_alpha=16,   # scaling: usually 1-2x rank; controls magnitude of updates

    target_modules=["q_proj", "v_proj"],  # which attention layers to adapt
    # For most models: ["q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj"]
    # For aggressive adaptation add: ["gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj"]

    lora_dropout=0.1,   # regularization: 0.05-0.1 typical
)
```

## Evaluating Fine-Tuned Models

```python
import anthropic
import json

def evaluate_model(model_fn, test_cases: list[dict]) -> dict:
    """
    model_fn: callable(prompt) → output string
    test_cases: [{"input": str, "expected": str, "check": callable}]
    """
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        output = model_fn(case["input"])
        [REDACTED_SQL_PASSWORD_1]ed = case["check"](output, case["expected"])
        results.append({"input": case["input"], "output": output, "[REDACTED_SQL_PASSWORD_1]ed": [REDACTED_SQL_PASSWORD_1]ed})

    [REDACTED_SQL_PASSWORD_1]_rate = sum(r["[REDACTED_SQL_PASSWORD_1]ed"] for r in results) / len(results)
    return {"[REDACTED_SQL_PASSWORD_1]_rate": [REDACTED_SQL_PASSWORD_1]_rate, "details": results}

# Test cases for SQL generation
sql_test_cases = [
    {
        "input": "Count orders by status",
        "expected": "SELECT status, COUNT(*)",
        "check": lambda output, expected: expected.lower() in output.lower()
    },
    {
        "input": "Top 5 customers by revenue",
        "expected": "LIMIT 5",
        "check": lambda output, expected: "LIMIT 5" in output.upper() and "ORDER BY" in output.upper()
    },
]

# Always evaluate:
# 1. On a held-out test set (not in training data)
# 2. Against the base model (did fine-tuning actually help?)
# 3. On adversarial inputs (does it handle edge cases?)
# 4. For regressions (did it lose general capability?)
```

## Dataset Construction Patterns

```python
# Pattern 1: Generate synthetic data with a stronger model
def generate_training_examples(task_description: str, n: int = 100) -> list[dict]:
    """Use Claude to generate (input, output) pairs for fine-tuning."""
    client = anthropic.Anthropic()
    response = client.messages.create(
        model="claude-sonnet-5",
        max_tokens=4096,
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"""
Generate {n} diverse training examples for this fine-tuning task:
{task_description}

Return as a JSON array: [{{"input": "...", "output": "..."}}]

Requirements:
- Vary complexity from simple to complex
- Include edge cases
- Outputs must be exactly correct
- No explanations in outputs — output only
"""}]
    )
    return json.loads(response.content[0].text)

# Pattern 2: Mine from existing system logs
def mine_from_logs(log_file: str) -> list[dict]:
    """Extract (user_query, good_response) pairs from production logs."""
    examples = []
    with open(log_file) as f:
        for line in f:
            entry = json.loads(line)
            if entry.get("feedback") == "thumbs_up":  # only use approved responses
                examples.append({
                    "input":  entry["user_message"],
                    "output": entry["assistant_message"]
                })
    return examples

# Pattern 3: Human-curated corrections
# Store: original_output, corrected_output, corrected_by, timestamp
# Fine-tune on: (input, corrected_output) pairs
# This is the highest quality data source
```

---

## Production Considerations

```python
# Serving a fine-tuned model
# Option 1: OpenAI fine-tuned model — just use the model ID
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:ft-myorg-abc123",
    messages=[...]
)

# Option 2: Self-hosted with vLLM (open-source models)
# vllm serve ./merged-model --port 8000
# Then call like any OpenAI-compatible API:
from openai import OpenAI
local_client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1", api_key="dummy")
response = local_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="./merged-model",
    messages=[...]
)

# Cost comparison at 1M tokens/day:
# GPT-4o:              ~$10,000/day
# GPT-4o-mini:         ~$300/day
# Fine-tuned GPT-4o-mini: ~$450/day (fine-tuning cost amortized)
# Self-hosted 8B model: ~$50/day (GPU instance)
```

## Common Mistakes

```
1. Fine-tuning to add knowledge
   Problem: model still hallucinates — fine-tuning teaches behavior, not facts
   Fix:     Use RAG for factual grounding; use fine-tuning for style/format

2. Too little data
   Problem: < 50 examples → model memorizes, doesn't generalize
   Fix:     Aim for 100-500 high-quality examples minimum; synthetic data helps

3. Low-quality training data
   Problem: inconsistent outputs → model learns inconsistency
   Fix:     Have a human review every training example; quality >> quantity

4. Skipping evaluation
   Problem: no way to know if fine-tuning helped or hurt
   Fix:     Build eval set before you start; measure base model vs fine-tuned

5. Over-training (too many epochs)
   Problem: model memorizes training set, fails on new inputs
   Fix:     Monitor validation loss; stop when it stops decreasing

6. No regression testing
   Problem: fine-tuning improves SQL but breaks summarization
   Fix:     Eval on diverse capabilities, not just the target task

7. Using fine-tuning as a shortcut for better prompting
   Problem: fine-tuning costs time and money
   Fix:     Exhaust prompt engineering first (few-shot, CoT, structured system prompt)
```

## Interview Questions

**Q: What's the difference between fine-tuning and prompt engineering?**
A: Prompt engineering changes the input without modifying the model — fast, cheap, reversible. Fine-tuning changes the model's weights by training on examples — more powerful for consistent behavior and style, but requires data, compute, and eval infrastructure. Start with prompts; only fine-tune when prompts can't achieve the goal consistently.

**Q: What is LoRA and why is it preferred over full fine-tuning?**
A: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) freezes the pre-trained model weights and trains two small low-rank matrices that are added to the original weights. It updates ~0.1% of parameters instead of 100%, reducing GPU memory from 56GB to ~8GB and training time from days to hours, while achieving comparable quality to full fine-tuning.

**Q: When would you choose fine-tuning over RAG?**
A: RAG is better for knowledge (facts that change, need citations). Fine-tuning is better for behavior (consistent format, style, custom classifications, domain-specific extraction). Often the right answer is both: fine-tune the model for behavior, add RAG for knowledge grounding.
